Brockman is a member of Skyward\u2019s \u201cCulture Club,\u201d a club consisting of a handful of employees from various departments who organize and oversee activities designed to boost coworkers\u2019 spirits and \u201cimprove the culture at Skyward.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSkyward Clubs,\u201d an initiative that allows employees to create clubs based around their personal interests, is one of the Culture Club\u2019s more recent endeavors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEach club kind of directs themselves,\u201d said Brockman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clubs introduced by fellow employees so far include volleyball, jiu-jitsu, several book clubs, a crocheting and knitting club, a biking club and a club called the \u201cCompanion Club,\u201d which dedicates its time to promoting pet adoption and sharing employee pet photos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently on the docket are a board game club and a photography club.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of COVID-19, workers across the country have struggled to rekindle their former social lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyward\u2019s staff consists of both remote and on-site employees, a feature that has allowed employee-led initiatives like the Culture Club to thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now looking for the opportunity to make connections or find a hobby, company employees have the opportunity to share their passions with one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Club creation is simple: As long as employees looking to form a club can find someone to act as a \u201cclub captain\u201d \u2013 someone who will spearhead the club\u2019s activities \u2013 the Culture Club will create a page on the \u201cClub Hub,\u201d a web page run by the Culture Club that allows Skyward employees looking to join a club to browse club activities, schedules, photos and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA lot of people have shown interest in different areas. We really need sort of that, like, expert, who\u2019s gonna say, \u2018Yep, I got this,\u2019\u201d said Brockman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more and more clubs join Skyward\u2019s roster, people who have worked in the same office for years \u2013 some since before the onset of COVID-19 \u2013 have found themselves learning more about the people around them to positive effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool to see a different side of someone come out,\u201d said Brockman, whose favorite part about the initiative is seeing the creativity of her coworkers \u2013 who she otherwise knows as programmers \u2013 shine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the knitting club, for example, refer to themselves as \u201cknitwits\u2019\u2019 and trade \u201cstring theory\u201d puns over balls of yarn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s all about \u201cdoing something social and having fun.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brockman says that the initiative has been met positively by fellow employees and upper management alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had amazing support by Skyward\u2019s exec staff, as well. They think this is great,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI feel like none of this would be possible without the leadership at Skyward. They\u2019ve been so supportive with the different events that [Culture Club has] been doing, and they\u2019ve been so supportive with Skyward Clubs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to work for a company that cares about its employees.

professions and passions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a fourth-generation cheesemaker, Luke comes from a long line of dairy farmers and cheesemakers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heather, educated in distilling with a master\u2019s degree in brewing science, has worked as a product development scientist aiding other distilleries and breweries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the first to distill spirits from milk sugar,\u201d Heather Mullins stated. \u201cThere are a handful of distilleries that do it worldwide. But it just feels right that we distill from milk in Wisconsin. We\u2019re confident that nobody is more committed to showcasing these spirits at their best,\u201d she adds. \u201cAfter all, dairy isn\u2019t just the pride of our state. It\u2019s the pride of our family.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the concept of distilling vodka and gin from milk sugar may seem novel, Heather points out that it\u2019s a concept dating back nearly a thousand years and produces traditional-tasting spirits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust like potato vodka doesn\u2019t taste like potatoes, milk vodka doesn\u2019t taste like milk. It\u2019s still a very traditional vodka. However, it has a smoother, more velvety texture due to its source,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowlton House teamed up with Logan Erikson, of Paper City Studios, to assist in the design, along with Marawood Construction of Marshfield to bring the distillery to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working with Marawood Construction on this project,\u201d Luke added. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to work with another local, family-owned business. Keeping both the design and construction local helps us to create a space that feels authentically Wisconsin while still meeting our unique needs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Construction on the distillery began in September 2022, with an anticipated opening of spring 2023.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette KNOWLTON \u2013 A family-owned and operated distillery will be opening soon in Knowlton, offering distillery tours, classes, craft cocktails and food, \u201cKnowlton House Distillery\u201d will be located across from Mullins Cheese, with a flagship product line called \u201cTenHead,\u201d which includes vodka and gin crafted from milk sugar (whey), a byproduct of cheese.

in specialty paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From packaging that keeps a favorite snack fresh to the pages of a beloved book, specialty paper can be found everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kristi Cain, vice president

they can thrive.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt Pixelle, everyone\u2019s voice matters. By increasing the diversity in our mills, we gain a wider range of perspectives that lead to greater innovation,\u201d Cain stated. \u201cThe women who hold many positions throughout our mills, including supervisor roles, are essential to our continued success. And we must remain committed to diversifying our industry by empowering women to share their unique voices and contributions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pixelle recently recognized three women employed at their Stevens Point mill who have broke the mold, while making a difference in the workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica Clements is the mill improvement process manager at the Stevens Point mill and has worked there for 23 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clements is responsible for leading projects that contribute to the continuous optimization of manufacturing processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The logical, concrete nature of math and science drew her to engineering, and after college, she \u201cfell in love with the excitement and dynamics of the paper industry.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She looks at key performance indicators, such as productivity, consumption rates and energy, across the mill\u2019s different production areas, finding opportunities to optimize processes and production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHer success is driven by her relentless pursuit of results, and she enjoys hands-on processes, as well as getting out on the floor to interact with operations crews around the mill,\u201d Cain stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clements said she first noticed how few women were in her field in college, and later that the crews she was managing were filled with men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice she gives to young women who want to enter the manufacturing field is to be\u201d confident in their skills and abilities \u2014 if they have the aptitude and desire to pursue a career, go for it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has two daughters and feels that the work she does shows them that they can pursue any career that they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samantha Hornik is the environmental supervisor at the mill, where she oversees a team that runs the Stevens Point mill wastewater treatment facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hornik\u2019s passion for natural resources began in the waters of her childhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She grew up outdoors, ice and boat fishing, which led her to earn an environmental degree in water resources and soil science management from the UW-Stevens Point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she knew she wanted to do something in the natural resource field, specifically with water, she wasn\u2019t sure which direction she wanted to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she saw that the Stevens Point mill was hiring a water treatment supervisor, she applied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her role, Hornik manages the mill\u2019s chemical approval process, compiles reports to ensure the mill stays in compliance with their Department of Natural Resources permits and oversees any waste the mill generates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is proud of the environmental efforts Pixelle takes and \u201cdoes the best she can for her community by helping to minimize the mill\u2019s impact on the land.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hornik knows how hard it can be to step into the industry, since there aren\u2019t many women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice she has for women entering the field is to \u201cnot be afraid \u2014 confidence is key.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more women join the field, she hopes that people will see that it\u2019s not uncommon for women to hold critical positions and make a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brittany Spencer never planned to work in paper, but after she took a job at a local mill just out of college, she loved the work and atmosphere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;As the paper machine senior production engineer at the Pixelle Stevens Point mill, Spencer is a second-generation paper worker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father was a rewind operator at another mill, and she often tinkered with her dad in his shop when she was young.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, combined with her love of math and science, led her to pursue a degree in chemical engineering at the UW-Madison and start her career in the paper industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Pixelle, Brittany loves the \u201cvariety and the collaborative atmosphere \u2014 everyone helps one another.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Some days she\u2019s crunching data, and others she\u2019s working with teams to optimize operations across the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She attributes much of her success to genuinely listening to the people she works with and helping them put their ideas into action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the people she works with are men, who, she says, \u201clisten to her in return and take her contributions seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although she was intimidated when she first walked into a conference room and recognized she was the only woman there, she quickly built confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice she\u2019d give to women entering manufacturing is to \u201cnot be intimidated, but, if you are, don\u2019t back down. Follow your dreams.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that to motivate more women to pursue manufacturing careers, it\u2019s important that they see other women thriving in the field.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Local women break the mold in specialty paper For the Gazette STEVENS POINT \u2013 Three local women are breaking the mold in the specialty paper industry.

They will all be as dear to me as Uncle Rod was,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo many veterans have resisted going on the trip thinking they are not deserving of it. Most veterans I have talked to have found real closure by connecting with other veterans on the flight, telling stories and searching out the name of a buddy on the wall who lost his life. Any way we can honor those who risked everything for our country is a no-brainer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for the production of the lager to raise funds came from a common alliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA friend of ours Brandon from B\u2019s Taphouse and 2 Doors Down Brewing in Wisconsin Rapids was telling me about how passionate he was about the Honor Flight and how he was raising funds with concerts and other events. With our statewide distribution we thought we could really make an impact by bringing awareness for the Honor Flight coupled with a great easy drinking lager,\u201d Marc recalled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe beer is a simple classic light lager that anybody would enjoy, but what makes it unique is giving $2 for every case and $14 for every 1\/2bbl sold to the Honor Flight in the area where the sale took place. It feels good to support a great cause while enjoying a great beer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, O\u2019so donated over $8,400 dollars to the Never Forgotten Honor Flight and will expand to assist all honor flight locations in Wisconsin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, they hope to raise $20,000 from sales and will also donate profits from their May run\/walk for the Never Forgotten Honor Flight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information on the event may be found at https:\/\/runsignup.com\/Race\/WI\/Plover\/OsoHonorFlightFunRunWalk5k.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lager is distributed through local beer distributors but may be purchased online www.osobrewing.com.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kris Leonhardt Editor PLOVER \u2013 O\u2019so Brewing Company is working to increase funding for Honor Flights throughout the state, by expanding production on their \u201cNever Forgotten Lager\u201d in 2023.

It is an affirmation of the confidence Sentry has in UW-Stevens Point.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPartland said Sentry recognizes a strong university is paramount to developing a skilled workforce and talent pipeline for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This new initiative builds on the company\u2019s successful partnership in developing UW-Stevens Point\u2019s data analytics program. Sentry also created the Sentry IT Co-op downtown, employing UW-Stevens Point students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt Sentry, we firmly believe the presence of a strong university is critical, not only for our company but for the community,\u201d McPartland added. \u201cAs a Fortune 650 company, headquartered in a small midwestern city, we\u2019re able to thrive due in large part to UW-Stevens Point. The university is creating career-ready graduates and contributing to a community culture that allows us to recruit and retain well educated, talented employees. We\u2019re proud and honored to be a part of this bold and transformative initiative to support the School of Business and Economics.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gift will help renovate an existing building, Collins Classroom Center, to create a state-of-the-art facility to house the Sentry School of Business and Economics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When renovations are complete, it will be renamed \u201cSentry Hall.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to updated facilities and technology, the gift will provide resources to enhance recruitment and business engagement activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs the Sentry School of Business and Economics, we will be able to significantly increase recruitment activities from a broader geographic area, particularly from diverse populations,\u201d said the school\u2019s head, Kevin Neuman. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSentry School of Business and Economics will provide students with a cutting-edge business education that goes beyond classroom learning. It will include an entrepreneurship center and Center for Women\u2019s Equity, Development and Leadership, serving both UW-Stevens Point students and the community. Experiential learning will occur through the Anderson Classroom to Career Center,\u201d a UWSP release stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe School of Business and Economics has experienced significant growth in the past eight years with Sentry\u2019s support and partnership. In 2016, Sentry provided a gift of $4 million to create a major in data analytics and endow two new faculty positions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlso in 2016, the School of Business and Economics received accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. In 2019, a master of business administration (MBA) in applied leadership and decision making was launched at all three UW-Stevens Point campuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cA stand-alone business school will raise the visibility of the program with regional businesses and will elevate the profile of the school for prospective students and partners. With the additional resources and renovated facilities, university leaders hope to double enrollment. Nearly 900 students major in one of seven business program options now.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renovation work could begin as early as 2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis gift will fast-track the planning and design process that involves UW-Stevens Point, UW System and state officials,\u201d the release added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis gift is historic on several levels,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt is our largest single donation.

Wisconsin-Stevens Point with a degree in marketing. Originally from Mason City, IA, he brings a passion for travel and the Stevens Point Area to his role. During his time in central Wisconsin, he was a member of the UWSP swim team earning four conference championship titles and serving as a captain for three years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs sales &amp; event experience manager for the SPACVB, he will be responsible for promoting the Stevens Point Area as an ideal place for meetings, conventions, and sports tournaments, building relationships with meeting and sports event planners,\u201d a SPACVB release stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Greenheck began working with the SPACVB as an intern in June 2021, transitioning to a full-time role prior to graduation from UWSP. As a student, she was a member of the UWSP women\u2019s basketball team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOriginally from Sauk City, she brings enthusiasm and a hospitality background, working in customer service and sports prior to her time at the bureau. In her role, she will lead partner efforts within the Stevens Point Area hospitality community acting as the primary contact between the SPACVB and its tourism partners. As part of her role, she will also manage the Stevens Point Area Gift Shop,\u201d the release added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plover partnership termination<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Village of Plover Tourism Commission recently terminated a 30-year partnership with the SPACVB, during their October 2022 meeting. The termination will be effective at the end of 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe termination of this partnership will create negative direct and tangible impacts throughout the region, including in the Village of Plover. Collaboration is powerful and necessary, even more so in a crowded tourism industry,\u201d SPACVB Executive Director Sara Brish and SPACVB Board Chair Greg Diekroeger said in a joint release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWithin Portage County, there are 27 municipalities. We exist as part of that larger community, with many who live in one community, while working, shopping, and doing business in others. The same is true for visitors, municipal boundaries do not matter. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor example, for six weekends a year, when the Village of Plover hosts tournaments at Woyak Park, visitors stay, dine, and explore well beyond the municipal borders of their municipality. The same is true for events across the county, from one of the state\u2019s largest soccer tournaments in Stevens Point to the Energy Fair in Custer, and all the events driving visitor traffic within Portage County. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUpon the termination of the partnership with the Village of Plover tourism, businesses in the Village of Plover will immediately see a loss of brand awareness. Instead of collaborating on a shared pre-COVID nearly $750,000 budget, the Village of Plover will have limited reach and opportunity. In fact, their current investment is roughly 1\/3 of the total budget. Our historic collaborative approach allows them to extend their limited reach well beyond what their investment can do on its own.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stevens Point Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau is an \u201ceconomic and community development organization whose purpose is to expand Portage County\u2019s economy by attracting conventions, sporting events and leisure tourists to Portage County.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gazette staff STEVENS POINT \u2013 The Stevens Point Area Convention and Visitors Bureau (SPACVB) has experienced several changes this fall, including some staffing adjustments.

meats and meals derived from a traditional favorite \u2013 mac &amp; cheese.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owner, Brandon McCormick-Guthu, said he was motivated to start his food truck business because of his passion for the culinary arts along with the financial freedom that comes with owning your own successful business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh man, there&#8217;s too much to love. It has created more family time which is beyond measurable. As a chef you work 80-90 hour weeks and don&#8217;t ever get to see your family. This way I can still live out my passion of being a chef and see my family,\u201d said McCormick-Guthu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnother great thing is working with my family. I get to watch my oldest son develop and grow and learn and do good and get complimented by random strangers for the job he\u2019s doing, which is very fulfilling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI want to make something of myself in this grand world, and owning your own successful businesses is definitely one way to do that and I\u2019m trying to work my tail off to do that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a whole, McCormick-Guthu wants to offer the community great food and a sense of community through his business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve evolved away from that awesome small town atmosphere of oh, \u2018hey, George, how&#8217;s it going?\u2019 And I think that community camaraderie goes a long way as far as our mental health and our mental prosperity goes. I think if you look at generations in the past, we had that,\u201d expressed McCormick-Guthu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to create some happy faces and if I can fill your bellies in the process, rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-1024x586.jpg\" alt=\"B3 BBQ &amp; Patsy\u2019s Mac\" class=\"wp-image-117439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-768x440.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-400x229.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819-1048x600.jpg 1048w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Food-Truck-2-220819.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>To celebrate the opening of B3 BBQ &amp; Patsy&#8217;s Mac, the Portage County Business Council hosted a ribbon cutting on Aug.11 at Central Waters Brewing Company. <strong>PCBC photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Layton Norris Intern PORTAGE COUNTY \u2013 To celebrate the opening of B3 BBQ &amp; Patsy\u2019s Mac, the Portage County Business Council hosted a ribbon cutting on Aug.11 at Central Waters Brewing Company.

We also carry high-end hiking shoe brands, backpacks, and various high-end camping gear such as tents, sleeping bags, sleeping mats, cooking accessories, and fuel,\u201d commented Cook. \u201cWe also have three different veteran-owned coffee brands to offer alongside our own coffee brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the year Cook plans to continue to build upon the reputation of his business. In addition, and plans to expand the size of his store and launch a full-service coffee shop.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur plan is to be the number one quality brand outfitter in Central Wisconsin and hopefully in 2022, we will be launching a full-service coffee shop. Eventually, our plan is to become a two-story retail store downtown,\u201d stated Cook. \u201cWe really want to work hard to be like what back-in-the-day would be considered an anchor store. So, anchor store meaning we are one of the main stores downtown that drives customers downtown not only to shop at our business but at other businesses too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Prior to opening Fall Line Outfitters Co., Cook served in the U.S Army for 22 years which is how he ended up in Stevens Point. When planning for his retirement, Cook decided that he wanted to open a business of his own in Stevens Point.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did 22 years in the military and I knew that when I was getting ready to retire that I would have to come up with a plan and I went with the idea that I wanted to have my own business,\u201d explained Cook. \u201cWe began by creating custom [military] apparel but then we started getting more into the outdoor stuff. So we were selling fly fishing goods, which is a passion of mine that I did when I was a small child and then we did some snowboarding and skiing goods, then we started getting into more of the outdoor apparel side of things. The business evolved and got into more high-end clothing and gear.

One of the more frequent questions we receive is, \u201cAt what age should I be shifting my investments more conservative?\u201d Prudent investing has something to do with age, but in fact has more to do with your time horizons. Regardless of age, typically we all have short-term, mid-term and long-term financial goals. Whether you are 15, 45 or 75, money that you plan to use in the next two years should be tucked away where the value is not subject to fluctuations that would disappoint you if the account dips when you need the money. In other words, this should be your most conservatively invested capital. Generally speaking, for monetary goals within two to ten years, we recommend a moderate investment objective, where you would not expect either home runs or strikeouts. Your long-term money should be invested in growth strategies that are appropriate for you. I have clients who have accounts that are intended to be multi-generational, in place for their children and grandchildren. In that case, their age is not a concern. Investing too conservatively would not align with their decades-long intention for the funds.<\/p>\n<p>You run the risk of loss if you invest your money too aggressively and need to sell investments when the markets are down. You run the risk of not optimizing the potential for reaching your goals if you invest too conservatively and miss out on opportunities for long-term growth. Both are risks. Rather than your age, let your goals and time frames guide you as to when you should shift to be more conservative.<\/p>\n<p>LouAnn Schulfer is co-owner of Schulfer &amp; Associates, LLC Wealth Management and can be reached at (715) 343-9600 or louann.schulfer@lpl.com. www.SchulferAndAssociates.com<\/p>\n<p>Securities and advisory services offered through LPL Financial, a Registered Investment Advisor.

Throughout the company\u2019s first year in operation, they outgrew the space they occupied, causing the owner to plan to relocate to the Artist &amp; Fare complex by mid-2022.<\/p>\n<p>Section 715 Throwing Co. is an ax-throwing establishment located on 3248 Mecca Drive in Plover.<\/p>\n<p>In celebration of the business\u2019s one-year anniversary, the owner of Section 715 Throwing Co. Sarah Smith hosted an anniversary party.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur one-year anniversary was amazing; we had throwers, regulars, league players and various business owners come visit us for free throwing for our anniversary party,\u201d Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout its first year of operation Section 715 Throwing Co. has experienced growth to an extent that the business may have to relocate to a larger space. Smith stated that \u201cour business has exploded since we opened up in January of last year, so much that we needed to look for more space about 2 months into it. We are on track to open in the new Artist &amp; Fare complex hopefully by late spring or early summer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Smith, Section 715 Throwing Co. is characterized as a unique, fun, and safe entertainment venue offering ax throwing for adults and kids 8 years and over. We offer beer, seltzer, soda, and water. We welcome you into a rustic urban setting that puts the guest at ease and encourages socialization.<\/p>\n<p>Before beginning the ax-throwing session guests will be instructed on how to safely and properly throw an ax. Guests are \u201cprovided with waivers, safety training, and answers to any questions they have. A hands-on throwing coach (Axe-pert) will help show each guest how to safely and effectively throw an axe. Coaches will not allow guests to play until they are comfortable with all guests throwing capabilities.\u201d Smith added that \u201cwe have spent a considerable amount of time ensuring the safety of all guests, and that is our top priority at all times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Section 715 Throwing provides various games which are easy to play and score. Additionally, as explained by Smith, \u201cguests enjoy walk-in play, parties, corporate events, and team building and league play. To mix things up we will have special events such as ladies\u2019 nights, date nights, and holiday-related events.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smith opened Section 715 Throwing Co. in 2021, after being inspired when she \u201chad visited another venue in Wisconsin and had an unbelievable experience and really thought that Plover and the surrounding area would benefit from something recreational to do as it was something the Plover area was lacking in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Smith\u2019s opinion, people come to her business because ax-throwing is something that anyone can do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have children as young as 8 years old throw [nearly perfectly]. Ax-throwing is a great way to socialize, compete, or just have fun.\u201d As a whole, Smith feels that \u201cwe have a unique vibe with the venue and I truly believe people like to be pushed outside of their comfort zones and ax-throwing provides that while still feeling safe and welcome,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Section 715 Throwing Co. is open on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3 p.m &#8211; 10 p.m, Fridays from 3 p.m &#8211; 11 p.m, Saturdays from 11 a.m &#8211; 11 p.m, and Sundays from 11 a.m &#8211; 4 p.m.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Layton Norris PLOVER &#8211; Section 715 Throwing Co. celebrated its one-year anniversary on Jan. 13.

The vacant building is situated in one of the most prime commercial corridors in Plover making village members eager to ensure that the building does not remain vacant. On Dec. 15, board members from the Village of Plover came to an agreement with developers Roland Lokre and Michael Masgay in regards to development plans for the vacant Younkers building.<\/p>\n<p>The agreement states that developers Lokre and Masgay will repurpose the building into an area of mass commerce that will house many businesses. The developers intend for the businesses that occupy the building to be classified as retail businesses. According to the Community Development Manager and Assistant Administrator of the Village of Plover Steve Kunst, \u201cretail is a broad term that can cover a lot of businesses, whether that be food and drink establishments, the sale of products, or offices.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The finalization date of these developments is currently unknown, however, Kunst informed that a portion of the building could be open to the public right away. There is an additional strip that is attached to the main Younkers building that is currently occupied. There have also been discussions with the [developers] and they have another potential tenant lined up for about 15,000 square feet of the building.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, although not open to the public, the building will be leasing out a portion of the building to the Board of Regents to allow for the University of Wisconsin &#8211; Stevens Point library to store books and any other paper materials in the building for three years while their new library is constructed.<\/p>\n<p>The developers of the building will receive financial assistance from the Village of Plover which will act as incentive payments to hasten the process of the development and thereby open the building to the public as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Kunst communicated that, \u201cthe village\u2019s incentive payments to the developer are broken up into two chunks. The first component was a $600,000 developer incentive payment, upfront, to help offset the cost of the real estate, and then subsequent annual payments of $100,000 for a total of $900,000 will be made.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The decision to commence the development process was made after the Younkers building sat vacant for five years, prompting the village to work to ensure that the large commercial area did not go unused.<br \/>\nAccording to Kunst, the \u201cvillage has been working for quite a while to try to do something with the property but struggled because the out-of-state investment company that owned the property wasn\u2019t all that motivated to sell.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The owners of the building listed the property at a significantly high price which left the village and any purchasers uninterested in re-opening the building. Kunst commented that this led village board members to fear that the building could end up like the former Econo Foods building which has been vacant for 20 years. Eventually, Lokre and Masgay, the same developers who took over the Shopko building that is adjacent to the Younkers building, inquired with the village about obtaining the property. This is when the village along with Lokre and Masgay came to an agreement that satisfies all parties.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the developments that will be made on the Younkers building will benefit the community by creating new jobs and by enabling people to purchase a plethora of goods and services in one location, thereby creating a local commercial district or village center.<\/p>\n<p>Kunst feels that the developments will produce positive benefits to the community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe village itself doesn\u2019t really have a downtown but I think with what we\u2019re seeing right now and what might be coming in the future with those couple of parcels is going to create a village center for lack of a better term. That currently doesn\u2019t exist, so in the long run, it\u2019s going to be a huge deal,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Layton Norris PORTAGE COUNTY &#8211; An agreement between the Village of Plover, and developers Roland Lokre and Michael Masgay has been made to develop and repurpose the former Younkers building into an area of mass commerce.

I think that as fast as he hung up the phone, he ran down (to Madison) and picked it up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dave and his older son, Shane, then began doing cue repair for people in the area and tinkering with building cues.<\/p>\n<p>When a nearby landfill wanted to purchase their hobby farm, the Jacoby family sold and moved into Nekoosa.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDad at that point grew the hobby more, so he was doing more cue repair, building more cues; just kind of growing the business in the basement really,\u201d Brandon recalled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt kept growing to the point where we built a shop alongside of the house \u2013 about 1,100 square-foot at the time. We moved the business from the basement to that shop.\u201d<br \/>\nBrandon, himself, originally had plans to be a police officer, but later came into the business full time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that once I started to work full time in the business, then it changed the business. I think that when you have someone that is full time in the business all of the things that you wish you could do and aren\u2019t doing, you are able to do because someone is there doing something all of the time,\u201d Brandon said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then, a good friend of mine, Shane Walker, started with me too, so it was just Shane and myself in the shop, and Dad was still at the paper mill.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe business just kept growing. It started to get to the point where it was borderline that it could become a full-time business if we really wanted to. We started working with a business consultant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI give my dad a lot of credit, because he was in the paper mill at the time. At the time he was 55, and he was working in the screens department, which in the mill that is a pretty good job because it is an air-conditioned office and you are watching, monitoring the machines. I think something had busted in the sewer, and he had to go down and shovel. I think at that point he decided \u2018I want to try building cues and take a shot; and if I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll never do it.\u2019 So, two weeks later he went into the office and quit. Basically, he knew that if he stayed in the mill that he probably would never take the chance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody said that he was completely nuts and that it was probably the most foolish thing that he had ever done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The business, however, kept growing and the family purchased a building in Nekoosa.<\/p>\n<p>The business eventually grew from a 150-square-foot space to 17,000 square feet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt every stage, we always think \u2018oh, this is way beyond what we are ever going to need for space.\u2019 But, I\u2019ve learned that when you increase your space you just naturally grow to accommodate that space. You hold off on making decisions based on \u2018I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t have the space or I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 But, when you come into a bigger space you just don\u2019t have that excuse anymore, so then it is really easy to keep growing.\u201d<br \/>\nFrom there, the Jacobys carved out a niche in a very large industry.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-116299\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NEWS-Jacoby-1-211222.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is interesting, and what people don\u2019t realize, is that some form of a cue sport (everywhere), whether it is playing pool or what we think traditionally is pool, but around the world most people don\u2019t play pool like we play pool. They play three-cushion billiards; they play snooker; they play Chinese eight ball; there is a Russian eight ball game. There are more people that play some form of a cue activity \u2013 a cue sport \u2013 then most other recreational activities. The global market for pool cues is probably $2 million a month,\u201d Brandon explained.<\/p>\n<p>The Jacoby\u2019s production accounts for a fraction of the market, but they are also doing business on the high end of the cue industry.<\/p>\n<p>The business often finds itself creating cues for professional pool players and celebrities around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Brandon said that their products are unlike others in a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unique and there is a story behind it. We really work hard to produce the best product we can and really work hard on our customer service,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of them are one-of-a-kind pieces. All of the design in the cues are cut and pieced in together. Most people look at the cues, and they think \u2018oh, they\u2019re painted,\u2019 because that is what most people would expect.<\/p>\n<p>But, they are not; everything is crafted together in little parts and pieces. So, when you see a colored piece, it is probably a piece of wood that has been inlaid and pieced in. Some of the cues can take hundreds of hours; it just depends on the design and the complexity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And, their commitment to quality shows. For the past 14 years, the business has been recognized for their creations by the American Cue Makers Association 13 of those 14 years, taking first or second place.<\/p>\n<p>Jacoby Custom Cues is located at 309 Market Street, in Nekoosa.

They don\u2019t just lend money \u2013 they also provide financial counseling and advice before and after making a loan. They work closely with communities to spur development, add quality affordable housing, and support small businesses, and many of our favorite small businesses in Central Wisconsin have benefited from lending from Community Assets for People, the CDFI managed locally by CAP Services. These investments have in turn strengthened our local economy and helped other small businesses succeed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCDFIs have made a tremendous positive impact in Portage County and across Wisconsin, and I am so proud to be reintroducing this legislation today to incentivize Wisconsinites to invest in them. Investing in CDFIs couples financial and social returns on investment, and this legislation will strengthen those returns. I am pleased to have the support of colleagues from both sides of the aisle who, like me, are inspired by the work our CDFIs are doing across the state, and I hope to see our legislation move through the Legislature expeditiously.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times MADISON &#8211; On Dec. 15, Rep.

Great Northern Distillery plans to vacate the Plover location and begin production in the new Stevens Point location by late April of 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Small-batch craft distilled spirits have become increasingly popular throughout central Wisconsin. One such distillery that has become a popular producer is Great Northern Distilling, which just recently announced its plan to move its location from Plover, to Stevens Point.<\/p>\n<p>Founder of Great Northern Distilling, Brian Cummins, announced that the move from Plover to Stevens Point is underway and that the company \u201chopes to break ground here in the next week or so, as long as the weather holds out.\u201d If the weather conditions remain ideal for construction, then the company plans to \u201cpour the footings and foundation for the building.\u201d From that point forward the \u201cprefabricated portions of the building [will be] delivered in mid to late February,\u201d which will then allow for the building to be \u201cclosed in,\u201d and for workers to proceed by \u201cworking [on] the interior.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Cummins, the company hopes to complete the construction that will allow for the company to start manufacturing on the new site by April of 2020. Cummins plans to include an improved \u201cTasting Room Bar\u201d in the new structure, which will provide guests with the ability to observe their drinks being made by a mixologist. The new Tasting Room Bar will have 29 seats as opposed to the 11 seats available at the Plover location. This larger and improved Tasting Room Bar will be finalized and opened to \u201cthe public in late June of 2022.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Along with the newly improved and far more spacious Tasting Room Bar, Cummins plans to include \u201can outdoor patio with a pergola, which will be dog-friendly.\u201d The patio will be equipped with heaters, which should allow for people to enjoy the patio for three-quarters of the year. In addition, there will be \u201ca new event space that will be on the second floor, [for the purpose of] hosting [private] events with up to 150 people.\u201d These new accommodations are planned to be opened to the public in late June of 2022 along with the Tasting Room Bar.<\/p>\n<p>Great Northern Distilling\u2019s current facility in Plover was originally a car dealership, which Cummins \u201cretrofitted into a distillery.\u201d When founding Great Northern Distilling, Cummins knew that he wanted \u201cthe business [to be] in central Wisconsin because of the [abundance of] great water, and agricultural ingredients in the area.\u201d The location of Plover was chosen simply for the availability of the building, which was \u201cperfectly sized\u201d for the distillery at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, the Great Northern Distillery \u201coutgrew the space [of the current facility,] and during COVID-19, the landlord [of the space that the distillery occupies decided] that he wanted to use the building for other purposes,\u201d which compelled Cummins to consider \u201cwhat [he] wants [Great Northern Distilling] to be for the next 10 or 20 years,\u201d and where would be best.<\/p>\n<p>When considering where the best location to move to would be, Cummins knew that he wished to remain in central Wisconsin. This led Cummins to consider downtown Stevens Point as the location that Great<\/p>\n<p>Northern Distilling would operate out of in the near future. Cummins ultimately decided that Stevens Point would be the ideal location for the distillery because \u201cdowntown Stevens Point really feels like the center of gravity [within] the area.\u201d Additionally, \u201cStevens Point and [the surrounding area] has such a good culture of creative entrepreneurs\u2026 It feels like there\u2019s a great energy of creation and revitalization in downtown Stevens Point, [and Great Northern Distilling is] excited to be a part of that.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Layton Norris PORTAGE COUNTY &#8211; Great Northern Distilling announces that it plans to construct a new facility in Stevens Point, which will replace the original location in Plover.

While many people know of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of an attorney in criminal cases, there is typically no such guarantee outside of criminal law: an area broadly known as civil law.<\/p>\n<p>However, civil law encompasses measures most people take for granted such as protecting their fundamental housing, employment, and medical care needs. A person who can\u2019t afford a lawyer often struggles to navigate the legal system\u2019s complexities. This struggle makes justice and stability elusive, and often creates costs for taxpayers in the form of courtroom inefficiency or the emergency services and public support needed when challenges fester.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows low-income people\u2019s civil legal needs typically go unmet, due to lack of resources or awareness. The COVID-19 pandemic has ballooned those needs, while decreasing funding from key sources.<\/p>\n<p>Nonprofit law firms and others use WisTAF\u2019s grants to offer advice, full legal representation, and access to online and in-person information to those who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford a lawyer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo much thought has gone into passing legal protections that are supposed to be available to everyone. We should make sure people can in fact access those protections, especially when the stakes are high,\u201d said Rebecca L. Murray, executive director of WisTAF.<\/p>\n<p>WisTAF, a nonprofit organization established by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, is the state\u2019s channel for general civil legal aid funding. In 2020, providers used WisTAF grants to assist more than 10,000 clients spread across every county in the state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The grant awards announced today come from two of WisTAF\u2019s civil legal aid grant programs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Direct Legal Services (DLS) allows providers flexibility to help low-income people address barriers to self-sufficiency. It is WisTAF\u2019s oldest and largest grant program. In 2020, the most common types of cases were those related to housing (29 percent), family law (11 percent), and guardianship issues (9 percent).<\/p>\n<p>-The Foreclosure Prevention\/Community Redevelopment Legal Assistance (FP\/CRLA) program catalyzes innovative practices to help low-income individuals and families stay in their homes and achieve financial stability. Simultaneously, providers in this program work at the community level to empower and stabilize groups facing disadvantage.<\/p>\n<p>Seventeen organizations received DLS grants for 2022, while six organizations received FP\/CRLA grants for both 2022 and 2023. Details are provided below.<\/p>\n<p>WisTAF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works with civil legal aid organizations in the state to increase access to justice. WisTAF oversees funds and invests in services to help people resolve legal problems.<\/p>\n<p>Portage County organizations include: Portage County Legal Aid Society, and the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of La Crosse.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times MADISON &#8211; The Wisconsin Trust Account Foundation, Inc.

With a back-door strategy, one would make a non-deductible contribution to an IRA and immediately convert to a ROTH IRA. The key point to remember is that back-door conversions involve non-deductible contributions of already taxed dollars. Ordinary Roth IRA conversions are when pre-tax dollars are converted, such as from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, creating an income-taxable event. Back-door conversions are on the agenda of congress to be banned, as the House<\/p>\n<p>Ways and Means Committee has already approved outlawing this strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-tax conversions could be subject to income limitations starting in 2032. Fortunately, this gives people an equal chance, regardless of income, to convert traditional IRA dollars to ROTH dollars for about another 10 years.

The branch will also offer Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs) both inside and outside under a drive-up canopy to provide fast, convenient service. The ITMs will allow members to interact with live, local tellers using video technology, where they can complete a wide range of services like cashing checks, making loans payments, transferring funds, depositing money, and getting cash.<\/p>\n<p>Lee said, \u201cThis investment continues our commitment to members who live and work in Central Wisconsin.

What will you leave behind that will make a difference to others? If you were to die tomorrow, how will you be missed?<\/p>\n<p>When I was growing up, there was a saying that there are only two things that are certain: death and taxes. Well now-a-days, many people don\u2019t pay taxes so I guess we can eliminate that one, but the one certainty of death does remain for us all at some point. We just don\u2019t know when.<\/p>\n<p>If you have life experience, chances are you know many people who have passed on and left a lasting impact on those they loved as well as others. Many lived long, deliberate and fulfilling lives which enriched others. Conversely, many were taken too soon, before their jobs were done here on earth.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve helped numerous people throughout my years as a Wealth Management Advisor evaluate the impact that their death will have on others, financial and otherwise. A substantial risk to any of life\u2019s plans is death of a key contributor, both financial and\/or effort, for families and business. What commitments have you made? What would happen if you were to die tomorrow?<\/p>\n<p>No one enjoys thinking about death and many people procrastinate with planning, but it\u2019s the one certainty for all of us. People tend to underestimate death\u2019s impact until they do a comprehensive analysis and identify the gaps that will need to be filled if they are no longer here at given points in others\u2019 lives, financial and otherwise. For most people, nothing is more important than taking care of their loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>What would happen if you were to die tomorrow?<\/p>\n<p>Helping people financially plan for their families or businesses for the lasting impacts that their death will have, has been of paramount importance to me for years. I\u2019ve personally experienced the premature death of a family member and its lasting impacts. I\u2019ve looked into the crying eyes of dear friends and clients, sharing their pain, when they have lost family members too early. One thing for certain, we can\u2019t bring our loved ones back. But with proper planning, everything does not have to change for your family or your business.

Every year, I have married clients who become single again whether through divorce or death of a spouse. There is even the difficult-to-define in-between time when the cognitive aptitude of one spouse slips away to dementia or Alzheimers disease. More often than not, women are left to pick up the pieces, especially in the case of widowhood.<\/p>\n<p>I often hear how overwhelming the new responsibility feels. After years of working in partnership as a couple, the thought of taking over \u201ceverything\u201d can make you feel defeated before you even start. A very dear, younger widow once said to me \u201cyou know how when you get married, they say two become one? I can tell you it\u2019s true, because I feel like half of me is gone.\u201d While our hearts may feel broken, our strategy to regain footing doesn\u2019t have to. My best advice is to take things one step at a time. Nothing has to be done in a rush, especially with financial accounts. You may have some decisions to make before the year\u2019s end, but in most circumstances, you can take the time that you need to learn, understand, contemplate, consult and make decisions. Identify your top priorities and work through those first. You do not have to do everything at once. Enlist the help of professionals who empathize with your pain but can see and work through matters objectively. If you feel pressured, trust your instincts and do not make decisions until they feel right. After all, women have great intuition, even with money and situations of taking over the finances.<\/p>\n<p>LouAnn Schulfer is co-owner of Schulfer &amp; Associates, LLC Wealth Management and can be reached at (715) 343-9600 or louann.schulfer@lpl.com.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By LouAnn Schulfer, AWMA, AIF Over the past couple of decades, I\u2019ve helped numerous single individuals and married couples with their financial decision making, planning and investments.

Either is perfectly fine as long as you don\u2019t confuse the two, and know which you are. Using the stock market as one example, a trader is someone who buys stocks due to their position in the market with a plan to react swiftly when certain valuation targets are reached, either in profit or loss. An investor, on the other hand, is someone who buys shares of companies whom they\u2019ve researched and feel comfortable investing in with the intention to profit from both dividends and capital appreciation over a longer time horizon. To compound the benefit, dividends are reinvested into more shares. An investor monitors the valuation of their security and if the price drops, analyzes the reason and determines whether the decline affects the long term viability of owning the stock. The reaction to volatility is very different in traders versus investors. The trader reacts regardless of reason for price movements. The investor continues to hold if the fundamentals of the company have not significantly changed, much like you would if you were the sole owner of that particular company. The investor\u2019s discipline is to NOT react to short term volatility, but rather with self-control and temperance with one eye on the economy, again, much like you would if you were the direct owner of your own business.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes in market volatility investors forget their disciplines and react like traders, but with no strategy or discipline. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not advocating that you unequivocally hold all of your investments regardless of circumstances. In fact, I am an advocate of active management of investments based upon their fundamentals, technical indicators, quantitative analysis, and their relative strength as well as cycles of economic health and deterioration. But investors can get burned when they forget that they are investors and allow their emotions to get the best of them, reacting like traders.<\/p>\n<p>Volatility is normal behavior for daily traded investments and pullbacks are expected as part of normal market cycles. While it may be uncomfortable to go through, volatility and pullbacks are like turbulence in an airplane. A few bumps does not mean the plane is going down. My advice to you is to remember which you are \u2013 a trader or an investor, and make sure your disciplines remain congruent and consistent with who you are, as either a trader or an investor.<\/p>\n<p>LouAnn Schulfer is co-owner of Schulfer &amp; Associates, LLC Wealth Management and can be reached at (715) 343-9600 or louann.schulfer@lpl.com. www.SchulferAndAssociates.com<br \/>\nSecurities and advisory services offered through LPL Financial, a Registered Investment Advisor.

Tony Evers\u2019 veto of Assembly Bill No. 367, which was designed to provide assistance in restarting the Wisconsin Rapids Verso mill.<\/p>\n<p>The bill, authored by Sen. Patrick Testin (Stevens Point) and Rep. Scott Krug (town of Rome), passed in the state Senate on June 30, after passing the Assembly on June 22.<\/p>\n<p>The bill would have provided a $50 million loan to a buyer for the Wisconsin Rapids paper mill and a $15 million loan to a buyer for the Park Falls paper mill. Both Verso mills are currently idle.<\/p>\n<p>The Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association (GLTPA) has also been working with the University of Wisconsin in forming a cooperative entity to purchase the mill and return it to operation as a soft\/pulpwood plant.<\/p>\n<p>Incorporated as Timber Professionals Cooperative (TPC), the group was working to obtain the necessary funding and making other arrangements with Verso to purchase and operate the mill.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, now we\u2019ve got this company, Atlas, who watched the veto happen, saw their opportunity and came in and said, \u2018Fine, we\u2019ll just do this on our own.\u2019 So, now we\u2019ve got competing interests. (We\u2019re) trying to see what lies ahead for the co-op, if Atlas is going to be the one jumping in now,\u201d Krug told Wisconsin Public Radio.<\/p>\n<p>Atlas said that the company is already a Verso investor and owns a little less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s voting capacity.<\/p>\n<p>Atlas and its affiliates are a cluster of 23 \u201cmanufacturing and distribution businesses in the automotive, building materials, business services and solutions, construction, energy, industrial services, metals, packaging, pulp, paper, and logistics industries.\u201d The company was founded in 2002, but says that many of their companies have been doing business for over a century.<\/p>\n<p>Verso Corporation confirmed that it received an \u201cunsolicited proposal\u201d from Atlas regarding a \u201cpotential transaction\u201d to acquire all outstanding shares of Verso Class A common stock for $20 a share in cash.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConsistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, Verso\u2019s Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and evaluate the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of Verso and its stockholders. Verso stockholders need take no action at this time,\u201d the release added.<br \/>\n\u201cThere can be no assurance that any negotiations between Verso and Atlas Holdings LLC regarding this proposal will take place, and if such negotiations do take place, there can be no assurance that any transaction with Atlas Holdings LLC will occur or be consummated. Verso does not intend to make any additional comments regarding the proposal or any other related matter or potential transaction unless and until it is appropriate to do so or a formal agreement has been reached.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Krug added that legislators will continue to work on potential means to assist in getting the Wisconsin Rapids mill up and running again, stating that it is the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the Wisconsin Rapids community job picture.<br \/>\n\u201cThis was the No. 1 employer up until June of last year; it\u2019s been the No. 1 employer for close to a century. So, this means about everything to Wisconsin Rapids to get this facility up and going again,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn its heyday, we had up to 6,000 people working in that mill throughout those heyday years.

I\u2019m glad that the tourism industry is getting much-needed help, but our paper and timber industries deserve to be priorities as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After passing the Senate by a vote of 20-12 the bill heads to Governor Tony Evers\u2019 desk.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis bill did meet with some opposition,\u201d Krug noted, \u201cSome in the legislature have asserted that this proposal may be a non-allowable use of federal stimulus money. However, none of our critics can point to anything in writing. I call on Governor Evers to sign this bill and give our proposal a chance to do good for Wisconsin,\u201d Krug said.<\/p>\n<p>Representative Krug is asking supporters of the bill to email Governor Evers and ask that he sign the bill into law. A website has been set up to assist with this at https:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/rapidstogether\/contact-the-governor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone in Wisconsin can write Governor Evers to support this bill,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe idling of our city\u2019s paper mill has already had a profound financial and social impact on our community, our region and our state. This bill poses an opportunity to inspire hope in our community while bringing back family-sustaining jobs and ensuring our paper professionals\u2019 expertise stays local. Now is the time to act on this bill,\u201c said Wisconsin Rapids Mayor Shane Blaser.<\/p>\n<p>Blaser\u2019s office also stated that \u201can estimated 2,686 jobs statewide are affected by the idling of the Wisconsin Rapids paper mill, which creates lost earnings for Wisconsin\u2019s people and lost tax revenues for Wisconsin\u2019s municipalities. The Wisconsin Rapids paper mill also consumed one-quarter of the pulpwood cut annually in Wisconsin, advancing timber and transportation industries throughout the state, while making an important impacton Wisconsin forestry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Verso mill was the largest employer in Wisconsin Rapids, with 905 employees, until June 2020 when the mill was idled.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gazette staff MADISON \u2013 A bill authored by Sen.

Prior to that, he had served as a district committeeman for CWEC for roughly 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>Oppor, a resident of Iola, served as a director for 12 years. Prior to becoming a director, Oppor worked for CWEC for 30 years, retiring as a lineman in 2001.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to becoming a director, Buss said he had a long history of cooperative membershipsince he grew up on a family farm.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing up with cooperatives in the family, I guess it just sort of rubbed off on me,\u201d Buss said.<\/p>\n<p>For Oppor, even though he worked for CWEC for 30 years out in the field, it was his curiosity about the business-side of the co-op that eventually led him to seek being a director. His time as a lineman proved to be beneficial once he became a director.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe rest of the board was asking me questions about things that took place out in the field, and I could answer them,\u201d Oppor said.<\/p>\n<p>It was also Oppor\u2019s time as a lineman that helped form his goals for his time as a director on the board. He knew what linemen endured out in the field and he wanted to make sure they had equipment needed to do the job efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>Buss said he didn\u2019t have any specific goals when he joined the CWEC Board of Directors, but knew the co-op would eventually need a new headquarters as the headquarters at that time, located in Iola, was \u201cvery antiquated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That goal was realized in 2011, when CWEC opened a new headquarters in Rosholt.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a building now that other co-ops, when we built it, other co-ops came and looked at it, and they used us as a model,\u201d Buss said.<\/p>\n<p>The accomplishment Buss is most proud of doesn\u2019t involve the construction of a new building, though.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf I ever got a question or complaint from a member, I tried to get them an answer and get the problem solved as quick as possible,\u201d Buss said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the thing I\u2019m most proud of and the thing I\u2019ve done throughout my career.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even though Oppor said he didn\u2019t enjoy the traveling aspect of it, he did enjoy attending meetings throughout the country.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d get to visit with other board members and bring that information back to our board,\u201d Oppor said. \u201cI thought that was pretty interesting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He added that he made a lot of friends during his time as a director, but part of his decision to not seek reelection was an effort to get \u201cnew blood\u201d on the board.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew ideas don\u2019t hurt,\u201d Oppor said.<\/p>\n<p>Citing health issues, Buss said the time was right to retire from the board.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the most enjoyable part of being a director is the camaraderie you develop with your other directors,\u201d Buss said. \u201cI think within the last 9-10 years the board of directors has stayed the same, so you get to know everybody very personally, and you almost develop a family, especially with your directors and some of the employees. Not only is the camaraderie on a local level, but it\u2019s also on a state and national level when you go to meetings you have to attend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both Buss and Oppor said they plan to spend more time with family during their retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Ron Onesti, of Wittenberg, was elected at the CWEC Annual Meeting April 27 to replace Buss. Onesti ran unopposed.<\/p>\n<p>Lou Oppor, of Scandinavia, defeated Gregory Loeser, of Iola, to replace Leonard Oppor. Lou Oppor received 204 votes, while Loeser received 170 votes.<\/p>\n<h4>CWEC Board elects new officers<\/h4>\n<p>When the CWEC Board of Directors met on April 29 it elected new officers.<\/p>\n<p>Director Tom Smith was elected as chair, while Director Mike Schultz was elected vice-chair and Director Lee Lehrer was elected secretary\/treasurer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two longtime directors leave CWEC Board<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":114404,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271],"tags":[3692],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

Ranked 23 out of all 72 counties for the state, Portage County has seen steady, incremental growth in visitor spending since 2012.<\/p>\n<p>While 2020 and the pandemic brought a decline in visitors spending with more than 100 groups (from conferences to tournaments) canceled, traveler spending is poised to rebound. Behind the scenes, the Stevens Point Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has been working to remain top-of-mind to locals and potential visitors, for when travel resumes.<\/p>\n<p>Wisconsinites may have not traveled far, but their local spending was felt by local businesses struggling to make ends meet and the shifting restrictions last year. The Stevens Point Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau helped to encourage locals to get out and explore, from outdoor assets to supporting local shops through promotions from the Fish Fry Giveaway, Ultimate Beer Roadtrip, and Merch Madness.<\/p>\n<p>Brish said increased use of outdoor recreation offerings, including a 60 percent growth in use on the Green Circle Trail, allowed the region\u2019s outdoor assets to shine. It also called attention to the outdoors as a vital part of the economy throughout Wisconsin, with a record number of state park visits and increased fishing licenses and camping stays.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re focused on the road ahead, supporting local businesses and encouraging visitors to join the recovery and plan their vacation days,\u201d said Brish.<\/p>\n<p>The Stevens Point Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau recently launched the Calling All Adventurers Sweepstakes, aimed at featuring local itineraries featuring things to see and do in the Stevens Point Area. The promotion, which runs through May 25 features weekly prize packages.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the challenges the travel industry faced, it still was a driver in communities around the state. Wisconsin welcomed 90.7 million visitors in 2020 in face of the pandemic. Employment supported by visitor spending tallied 107,500 jobs in the state \u2013 more than the population of Green Bay.<\/p>\n<p>Later this summer, to continue to support local businesses and tourism assets, the Stevens Point Area will host a Tourism Takeover. The promotion will encourage locals to participate in a Bucket List Bingo, featuring things to see and do in the Stevens Point Area.

Scott Krug (R-Rome) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) have authored a bill to provide assistance in the purchase of the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids.<br \/>\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve figured this out. There is already a building. There is equipment, there is expertise, and there is a proven need for product. There is everything needed except for a portion of the money, and this bill would close that gap,\u201d Krug said.<br \/>\nThe Verso mill was the largest employer in Wisconsin Rapids, with 905 employees, until June 2020 when the mill closed.<br \/>\nThe mill is owned by Verso Corporation, Ohio-based corporation, who decided to close the mill \u201cdue to paper industry trends that were greatly accelerated and exacerbated\u201d by COVID.<br \/>\nThe mill was the final destination for about one-quarter of all the pulpwood cut in Wisconsin, with the closure affecting companies outside the mill as well.<br \/>\n\u201cThis means that the effects of the mill closure extend far beyond the 900 jobs in Wood County; without the mill serving as a reliable buyer of softwood, hundreds of small timber cutters have struggled to find buyers for soft\/pulpwood,\u201d a joint release from the legislators stated.<br \/>\n\u201cLoggers have become less willing to cut wood they cannot sell and this affects thousands of landowners participating in the Managed Forest Law (MFL) program. If these landowners are unable to follow the management plans they have filed with DNR (plans that include scheduled cutting of timber) their participation in the program is at risk. This could mean that landowners would have to pay back the property tax savings they had received from their participation in MFL.<br \/>\n\u201cFurther, if the schedule of soft\/pulpwood timber cutting in Wisconsin is impaired due to a lack of market for the wood, consequences will result for Wisconsin\u2019s tourism industry as well as for the state of fire safety in Wisconsin\u2019s forests if our forests are not healthy.\u201d<br \/>\nThe Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association (GLTPA) has been working with the University of Wisconsin to form a cooperative entity which would purchase the mill and return it to operation as a soft\/pulpwood plant. The Timber Professionals Cooperative (TPC) has now been incorporated and is making significant progress on obtaining the necessary funding and other arrangements with Verso to purchase and operate the mill.<br \/>\n\u201cPurchase of the mill by the cooperative would mean that an employee-owned mill with experience and expertise behind it, would again be making paper and employing people in Wisconsin Rapids. The mill would be owned by its own workers and would operate in the best interests of employees and customers. (There would be some opportunity for investors to join the purchase and such investors would also hold some share of the ownership as well,\u201d the release added.<br \/>\nThe bill proposed by Krug and Testin would provide loaned funds to partially close the gap between the price of the mill and the funds that the cooperative has been able to raise, by allocating $50 million from federal pandemic stimulus\/relief funds \u2013 the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 \u2013 to the purchase of the mill. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) would be the entity making the loan.<br \/>\n\u201cThe allocation would be a loan, not a gift. The mill is expected by all observers to be back in operation in fairly short order once a sale is agreed to; the purchasers (and other industry observers) are fully confident that the operation will be profitable and will continue for the foreseeable future as a pulpwood operation,\u201d the release stated.<br \/>\nThe bill requires that before the cooperative receive a loan of stimulus funds through WEDC, the cooperative would have to obtain significant funds from other sources.<br \/>\nThe plan also requires participation by the State of Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands (BCPL). Because BCPL land holdings are mostly in timber, BCPL is greatly concerned about the loss of the mill as a market for soft\/pulpwood. BCPL has indicated that it is able to consider a loan toward the purchase of the Verso mill.<br \/>\nThe bill would require funding from BCPL as well as from private sources, before the loan could be made by WEDC from stimulus funds.<br \/>\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to maintain and revitalize a major Wisconsin employer whose work advances the paper industry, the timber industry and our forest resources, and helps maintain the tourism role of managed woodlands in our state. The benefits to the Wisconsin Rapids community are significant, but frankly those benefits PALE in comparison to what\u2019s at stake statewide,\u201d Testin said.<br \/>\nKrug and Testin are seeking legislative co-sponsors for the proposal, which was scheduled to be introduced this month.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette MADISON \u2013 Rep.

The application is available at createyourcommunity.org\/eda, and the first round will close on May 15.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of the grant, CREATE will select one applicant from each of the 10 counties supported by the North Central Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.

CREATE will continue to work with these communities to coach them through the successful implementation of these three projects.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs part of that mapping process, CREATE will identify five locations for regional innovation hubs to spread its IDEA Center concept across the region.

The USGA first developed the network in 1981 to relieve the burden placed on clubs and golf associations to manage golfer handicap data on their own. The vast majority of golf courses and golf associations in America are now part of the GHIN ecosystem, with updated GHIN products released to accommodate the launch of the World Handicap System last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe immediate investment in technology will accelerate the delivery of new services and fuel a pipeline of new features that will directly benefit golfers. Clubs and golf associations across America will continue to benefit from robust player data, allowing them to encourage new playing opportunities at the local and regional levels,\u201d the release added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPartners like Sentry are helping us empower the broader golf community with the innovation that it needs to bring more people to the game and keep them engaged,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAdvancing these tools plays a vital role in how the business of golf operates at local courses across America.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As part of the partnership, Sentry will participate in the USGA\u2019s corporate hospitality program while also co-creating a custom content series, community outreach program, and broadcast integrations.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes following the USGA\u2019s annual meeting, the association\u2019s yearly gathering of its member clubs and stakeholders throughout the golf industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>USGA, Sentry partner for recreational golf<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113635,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,1155],"tags":[1257],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

I think there is so much power in creating networks of women across the state who are able to learn with, and from each other,\u201d said Kirsten Slaughter, WiWiC regional coordinator for the northwestern region of the state. \u201cI am thrilled to work with our partners to build connections around conservation in Wisconsin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wisconsin Women in Conservation (WiWiC) is a broad statewide coalition of organizations dedicated to sustainable agriculture and conservation education, with funding from the USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Michael Fields Agricultural Institute as the lead is partnering with the Wisconsin Farmers Union, Renewing the Countryside, E Resources Group, and the Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service (MOSES). Other participating agencies include Pheasants Forever and county land conservation departments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs both a woman landowner and a conservation educator, I have had the opportunity to attend and help facilitate various workshops in a women-only setting like the ones Wisconsin Women in Conservation are hosting, and have found them very empowering,\u201d said Farm Bill Biologist with Pheasants Forever Julie Peterson. \u201cShared space for women with a mutual passion for conservation brings out ideas and resources. It\u2019s that collaborative spirit of women and these kinds of settings enable us to be stronger together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Zoom events will feature regional soil experts, wildlife biologists, and others who can provide technical assistance and possibly funding to help participants put more conservation practices in place on their land. The group also plans to do in-person field days and farm demonstrations later in the year. One of the goals of the group is to promote networks of women landowners who can help each other transform their properties, and the group will provide Conservation Coaches to those who want them.<br \/>\n\u201cWomen are nurturers &#8230;of their families, of their land, of the earth. Women are also change makers and transformers for which not much credit is given to them. I am excited about this project because this focuses on women\u2026.and what they can do.\u201d said WiWiC Lead Coordinator Dr. Esther Shekinah, a research agronomist at Michael Fields Agricultural Institute. \u201cBy bringing conservation to the doorsteps of women of today, imagine the changes we can bring about in conserving the natural resources for our future generations\u2026.that\u2019s exhilarating!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Women landowners are a growing demographic. The 2017 Census recorded 38,509 female producers in Wisconsin, showing that women make up 35 percent of all producers in the state. \u201cThat\u2019s a 16 percent increase in the number of female producers from the 2012 census,\u201d said Shekinah. \u201cThough many of these women would like to support sustainable agricultural practices that would help them leave their land for future generations in a state of oneness with nature and better soil health, their lack of exposure to or knowledge about such agricultural practices impedes their acting on these impulses. This new Wisconsin Women in Conservation initiative aims to address that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Registration is open at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiwic.org\">www.wiwic.org<\/a>.

This was spurred mainly by COVID and more families cooking at home as opposed to eating out,\u201d explained Wisconsin Potato &amp; Vegetable Growers Association Promotion, Communication and Consumer Education Director Dana Rady.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEarly on during the pandemic, it was difficult to keep retail store shelves adequately stocked. There has been a consistently-high level of demand ever since.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDehydrated potatoes recorded the highest sales increases in dollars by 30 percent and volume sales by 25 percent. Canned and bottled potatoes saw the second-largest dollar increase at 29 percent, and frozen potatoes had the second-largest volume increase at 23 percent. The largest growth in dollar and volume sales for potatoes occurred from April through June, although all months grew by over 9 percent for both metrics,\u201d Potatoes USA stated in a newsletter regarding figures compiled by IRI.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs Potatoes USA cited, \u2018fresh potato sales increased by almost 21 percent in dollars and 15 percent in volume.\u2019 With the exception of potato sides found in the deli department, dollar sales in all other potato categories increased by double digits. This is really quite remarkable considering that prior to COVID, the majority of people and millennials especially, were spending more time in restaurants instead of cooking at home. The last year has really shifted the paradigm and had WPVGA focusing even more on sharing resources about nutrition, varieties produced in Wisconsin and ways to prepare those varieties,\u201d Rady added.<\/p>\n<p>Rady said that reasons for the increase in sales may be twofold.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore and more people are paying attention to their health and making wise choices when it comes to the food they put in their bodies. This is especially true since the pandemic began. Wisconsin potatoes are naturally nutritious. They are full of vitamins and minerals and free of fat, gluten and cholesterol. They are also packed with potassium and are sodium free, which makes them a heart-healthy option. Potatoes help you feel full for longer periods of time and provide the most nutrients per penny,\u201d Rady explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoreover, with people cooking more meals at home, they are looking for something that is easy, versatile, packed with flavor and healthy. Wisconsin potatoes easily accommodate all of that. They are fit for any meal as well as snacks and even desserts. Furthermore, potatoes maintain their quality under the proper storage conditions. It\u2019s for good reason potatoes are America\u2019s favorite vegetable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rady said this is good for the Portage County area, \u201cAs the number one potato-producing state east of the Mississippi, buying local is extremely important in supporting Wisconsin\u2019s family-owned farms and the foundation of our food supply.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe majority of Wisconsin\u2019s fresh and processed potatoes come from the state\u2019s Central Sands area, so looking for Wisconsin potatoes in retail stores, for example, also ensures that you\u2019ll get a fresher product at a lower carbon footprint. That is to say that the food traveled less miles to get to its destination, which ensures a higher quality for your family.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, farmers feed families and work very hard at doing it while also conserving Mother Nature\u2019s resources for future generations. But the economic benefits go even farther. Wisconsin agriculture is essential when it comes to jobs and creating quality relationships with area businesses.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Potato industry sees record demand in 2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113460,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,787,10],"tags":[3447],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

Submitted photo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I wondered why these delivery services for products and food didn&#8217;t use bicycles in &#8216;flat&#8217; Stevens Point, where you can pretty much access anything in a mile or two,&#8221; Roark said. &#8220;And I love to bike, so this just made sense to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Roark always biked to work, and decided instead of biking to UW-Stevens Point, he could start delivering packages. He partnered with the Stevens Point Area Co-Op and began to deliver groceries just two months after losing his position at the university.<\/p>\n<p>His list of partners has now grown to Central Rivers Farmshed, Meet the Herb Halfway, Zest Bakery &amp; Coffeehouse, Whitefeather Organics, Liberation Farmers, and Cattail Organics. His newest partnership with Kindred Spirit Books in downtown Stevens Point will also allow customers to place orders for books, jewelry, gift items, and more in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, Roark is the sole rider for Curbwise, but he hopes to grow his staff and acquire more delivery bikes in the coming years. The local entrepreneur also hopes to expand his number of partnerships and is always interested in speaking with local business owners about delivery opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Curbwise&#8217;s year-round delivery services may seem simple to some, but dealing with winter weather can take some preparation, according to Roark. He dresses in layers and brings changes of gloves in case they get wet or his hands get sweaty.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I always like to say, there is no bad weather, just bad gear,&#8221; Roark joked.<\/p>\n<p>Roark&#8217;s company started after he lost his job, but his commitment and passion have allowed Curbwise to be a highly-oiled link in the bike chain of the Stevens Point economy. The business works symbiotically with its partners to make sure locals get the goods they want, in a safe and eco-friendly way.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Curbwise LLC, visit gocurbwise.com or call 715-570-1961.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Taylor Hale STEVENS POINT &#8211; When snow is falling and the temperature plummets to -8\u00b0, most Wisconsinites would leave their bikes in the garage, not Trevor Roark.

This Rise Up Scholarship Program is intended to support solar workforce development efforts and expand employment access in advanced energy by providing renewable energy training scholarships and paid solar internships to students. Since the program\u2019s inception in 2020, MREA has hosted four trainings in three cities across the Midwest reaching 35 students, with ongoing commitments to expand training in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>MREA\u2019s partners include: NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program, Indiana; Walnut Way Conservation Corps of Milwaukee; Soulardarity of Highland Park, Michigan; and Renewable Energy Partners of Minneapolis, Minnesota.<\/p>\n<p>MREA coordinates with each partner to provide introductory information about the training program and career opportunities in the solar industry. The partners help recruit training participants and work with MREA to support their success.<\/p>\n<p>To raise money for the scholarship program, the MREA launched the Rise Up Giving Campaign in September 2020 with a goal of raising $30,000 to offer 30 renewable energy training scholarships to students in communities with persistent and high unemployment. The training program provides each scholarship awardee free entry-level training with the ability to attain the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) PV Associate credential. Recipients are also encouraged to apply for a select number of paid solar internships following the solar training.<\/p>\n<p>MREA surpassed its campaign goal, raising $30,675 from over 230 donors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the MREA\u2019s beginning in 1990, it has fought for market rules and investments which would expand ratepayer access to energy efficiency and clean energy. Over the last five years, MREA has increasingly focused on the Just Energy Transition to ensure that investment and opportunities are brought to communities that need them most,\u201d an MREA release stated.<\/p>\n<p>Nick Hylla, MREA\u2019s Executive Director, says that the focus on a \u201cJust Energy Transition\u201d should be a priority for economic development in Midwestern States.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike when the MREA started working on these issues more than 30 years ago, the transition to local clean energy does not face any major technical or financial barriers. The real challenges are social. How do we make sure that our efforts create jobs where they are needed, like in the growing number of communities where coal plants are closing? And, how do we ensure access to energy efficiency and solar energy for people that most need the energy savings and local economic development that come with clean energy investments?\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the program, visit www.midwestrenew.org\/riseupgiving.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MREA offers internships, scholarships<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113402,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,786],"tags":[3427],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

Alex started working for Okray Family Farms, Plover, in 2016, after graduating from St. Norbert College with a degree in business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI decided to join the family business after I graduated because agriculture is a strong field to work in, and because I had a rare opportunity to work for a business my family owns,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the fourth generation to work for our company, and it\u2019s great to continue the work my family has been doing for over 100 years. I also enjoy knowing that the work I do helps feed families across the country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though Okray tries to be involved with every area of the company, he is mainly responsible for finances and human resources.<\/p>\n<p>He is currently serving his first term as a WPVGA Board member and is part of the Water Task Force and Grower Education committees, while also serving on the Vegetable Committee. Outside of work, he serves as a board member for the United Way of Portage County and on United Way\u2019s Executive Committee.<\/p>\n<h4>Dr. Yi Wang<\/h4>\n<p>The WPVGA Researcher of the Year Award went to Dr. Yi Wang, an assistant professor and state extension specialist working on sustainable vegetable production in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Horticulture. Yi has published 17 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals and received about $1.5 million in research funding.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe goal of my research and extension program is to conduct science-based applied research and collaborate with potato and vegetable growers and processors,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>This collaboration includes work in improving the resource use efficiency and sustainability of vegetable cropping systems and reducing the impact of vegetable production on the environment. She is a WPVGA base-funded researcher in potato and vegetable production.<\/p>\n<h4>Kenton Mehlberg<\/h4>\n<p>The WPVGA Associate Division Business Person of the Year Award was presented to Kenton Mehlberg of T.I.P., Inc. and AgGrow Solutions, in Custer. Kenton completed his second term of service on the WPVGA Associate Division Board of Directors in February. He has served the last two years as President of the Associate Division Board and demonstrated outstanding leadership, especially in light of all the challenges the industry faced in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>With extensive safety protocols in place, the Associate Division conducted a successful golf outing in the summer of 2020, which raised thousands of dollars for the industry.<\/p>\n<p>To engage even more members, Kenton helped bring a new idea to fruition in 2020 \u2013 the first annual Trap Shoot Event at the Wausau Skeet and Trap Club, in Brokaw. Kenton knows that not everyone is a golfer, so he decided to offer an alternative activity that he knew would be popular with many members.<\/p>\n<p>The Trap Shoot was a success, with a full flight of 15 five-person teams. The event also served as one more fundraiser for the Associate Division, which raises funds every year for scholarships and grants among its many programs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile serving as president of the Associate Division the past two years, Kenton has shown distinguished leadership skills, including integrity and positivity along with great vision.

It is the intention of the WPVGA to continue to honor individuals who have made significant contributions to the potato industry in Wisconsin by making annual Hall of Fame inductions.<\/p>\n<p>In 1953, Norm and Marv\u2019s father, Clarence, began potato farming on a 40-acre parcel of land with an irrigation system. After graduating high school, Norm and Marv were given the opportunity to pursue further education or join Clarence in the family potato business; they chose to work with their father.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Worzella &amp; Sons grows 1,800 acres of potatoes, along with 3,400 acres of other vegetable crops.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are proud of the business\u2019s growth, which is largely attributed to the dedicated employees we\u2019ve had in our 60 years of farming,\u201d said Norm. \u201cWe are glad to work alongside our sons, who are the third generation of this business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe learned from our dad from a young age on. We started working with Dad in 1955, and we incorporated in 1964. Dad worked side-by-side with us and taught us how to grow vegetables and get started in farming.\u201d Marv added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNorm and Marv\u2019s parents, Clarence and Regina, were community-minded people who generously donated to many organizations and causes. They instilled in Marv and Norm the importance of giving back, and Worzella &amp; Sons has been able to make donations that are crucial to the well-being and future of the Wisconsin potato and vegetable growing industry,\u201d a WPVGA release stated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking with Louis Wysocki, the WPVGA and Village of Plover, the Worzellas participated in a land exchange, discontinuing to farm a parcel of fertile land to make room for the Little Plover River Watershed Enhancement Project. The goal of the project is to improve the health of the Little Plover River and the quality of life of the surrounding community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Worzellas also donated more than 20 acres of land to the Farming for the Future Foundation for a new Discovery Center to be built along the Highway 39 corridor, in Plover, within the next two years. The Discovery Center promises to connect Wisconsin families and the agriculture industry through education and experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMarv and Norm have also been instrumental in donating for causes such as improvements at Lake Pacawa Park, in Plover.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Being in the business of farming for over 60 years, they have operated numerous pieces of equipment and worked in each part of the farm. They stated that a big part of a successful farm is to keep up with technology.<\/p>\n<p>And as the farm expanded, bigger equipment was needed. Norm remembers harvesting potatoes and boxing them up by hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t like picking and grading them, but I picked a few,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow you have Lenco 12-row harvesters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI did some spraying with a little sprayer and then we got a bigger sprayer that we pulled with a rope. There were no air-conditioned tractors back then. You sat in the open. I couldn\u2019t even run the machines we have now.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to have had the opportunity to provide better equipment for our employees to do their jobs more efficiently.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marv says he liked getting up every morning, going out into the field and seeing how the potatoes were doing, watching them grow. Even though he is 84 years old now, he still visits the fields.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like watching the potatoes grow, from seed potatoes to plants and then to being harvested,\u201d Marv said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WPVGA recognizes Plover potato growers<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113334,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,2089],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

They were not specifically searching for a Point Beer truck, but came across it by accident when they were looking at another vehicle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mihna is an Amherst native who has been working on trucks with his father since he was 12. He has engaged in preserving old trucks and antiques for most of his life but made the passion his main source of income after he was diagnosed with Lyme disease about two years ago.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_113309\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113309\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-113309\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Point Brewery Truck\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/NEWS-Point-Truck-3-210212.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-113309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The truck will be parked outside of the Stevens Point Brewery Gift Shop, located at 2617 Water Street.

Then we went and grabbed it to take back, and knew it was the Point Beer truck.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mihna pieced together the truck, adding headlights and a tailgate, before getting in contact with the Drechsler family. Birrenkott and others at the brewery see the truck as a missing puzzle piece that has found its way back into place and are thankful to once again be in possession of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Point Beer purchased the truck in late January. Birrenkott said that the truck was used to make deliveries, and also drove in parades and local events. While brewery staff doesn&#8217;t have any current plans to restore the truck to running order, they are keeping the door open.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We would love to drive this down Main Street in a future downtown parade,&#8221; Birrenkott closed.<\/p>\n<p>The truck will be parked outside of the Stevens Point Brewery Gift Shop, located at 2617 Water Street.

The group also asked for funding in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is something I had promised the Stevens Point Alliance I would bring up as part of the budget process,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;They had sent a request earlier in the fall, and I told them I would indeed do that, and I didn&#8217;t, so it was my failure to bring it forward as part of the budget process. So, I&#8217;m bringing it forward now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SPA representatives wrote in a note to the committee that the funding would help them grow their organization while helping the downtown landscape expand, stating &#8220;This is our second year in asking for help, but this year more than ever, it is needed. In 2020 we could not do any fundraising, including the membership dues that were suspended because of COVID. Yet we still had costs to maintain the organization. Just like any other business we have insurance, legal expenses, accountants, and IT personnel.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ryan Kernosky and Tori Jennings were against providing funding to the group.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, some leaders felt that offering funding to the Stevens Point Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, located on Main Street in the city&#8217;s downtown, could be a more productive alternative for local promotion and marketing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They have never provided any specific information about how the money will be used, expected outcomes, or how this will be measured,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The downtown alliance doesn&#8217;t represent all of downtown. It represents the members paying into the alliance, which is about half of the downtown businesses and property owners.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mayor Mike Wiza also spoke out against providing the funding.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a small group, representing a portion of some downtown business owners,&#8221; Wiza said. &#8220;I would submit that if (the committee) is looking into funding some marketing dollars to downtown, that those funds be directed to the Conventions and Visitors Bureau.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wiza added that the bureau could also provide logistics and more in-depth analytics on marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Comptroller Corey Ladick said if the city were to provide the funding, it would come from the city&#8217;s $100,000 contingency budget.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s $100,000 we have in the operating budget for things that come up,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Wiza said that the city is looking into creating a Business Improvement District (BID) focused on the downtown area, but its creation could be pushed into 2022 or later.<\/p>\n<p>SPA members noted that many shops could not wait that long.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have continued to work with the city to form a BID, but we will not have that funding available till probably 2023. If it goes through, the city tried once before, and it failed. Keep in mind the BID is nothing more than an additional tax on the already stretched businesses. We would appreciate some financial help bridging the gap until the BID monies would be there,\u201d the SPA statement added.<\/p>\n<p>No members of the SPA were present during the meeting to speak about the funding request.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson asked for a SPA representative to join next month&#8217;s finance committee meeting to discuss the possibility of funding the group.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Taylor Hale STEVENS POINT \u2013 During a Feb. 8 meeting, finance committee members looked at the possibility of funding the Stevens Point Alliance (SPA) up to $20,000 for marketing endeavors.

Portage County Business Council (PCBC) shares profiles of the entrepreneurs who make central Wisconsin thrive.<\/p>\n<p>Hosted by Mid-State Stevens Point Campus Dean Ben Nusz and Portage County Business Council Executive Director Todd Kuckkahn, \u201cProfile: Central Wisconsin\u201d takes a deep dive into the origin stories of central Wisconsin\u2019s local innovators and explores what the future holds for the community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has forced us to rethink how we can interact with and learn from our local business leaders,\u201d Nusz said. \u201cThrough this podcast, we can explore these organizations, peak into their windows and turn back the clock to when they started.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The debut episode of \u201cProfile: Central Wisconsin\u201d features Rusty Mitch, president of Portesi Italian Foods. In it, Mitch shares the story of how the first Portesi pizzas had to be made with American cheese because they didn\u2019t have access to fresh mozzarella and how a softball team\u2019s encouragement led his grandfather to start selling frozen pizzas in local bars.<\/p>\n<p>Other upcoming episodes will detail how Doug Munsey and his partner started their global wheelchair manufacturing business, Ki Mobility, out of a barn in Canada, as well as how Jared Linzmeier, co-owner and CEO of Ruby Coffee Roasters, stumbled into the world of craft coffee roasting after happening upon a logo he liked on the streets of Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a great way to showcase some of the businesses in our community that have started here, grown here and become cornerstones of what makes it so great to live in central Wisconsin,\u201d Kuckkahn said. \u201cWe learn not just how the business grew but also how the individual grew right alongside.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew episodes are planned for release every two weeks, including guests such as Joe Martino from the Stevens Point Brewery, Josh Stolzenburg from North Wind Solar and Scott Groholski from Point of Beginning,\u201d a Mid-State release explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Mid-State, we know that the trajectory of most businesses is non-linear. We want to learn about all the bumps in the road that lead to such robust organizations,\u201d Nusz said. \u201cAll of our guests are exceptional but started from humble beginnings. Highlighting these stories, provides our students with clear examples of success and hopefully allows them to see their own potential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit mstc.edu\/podcast.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mid-State Tech and PCBC sponsor program<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113122,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,2783],"tags":[3346,2810],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

The idea: offer customers gift cards to entice them to branch out to other local restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Local businesses are owned by families that live in town, so for us, to get together and help who needs it is important,&#8221; Melendez explained. &#8220;My customers are going to appreciate it, and they will go to them and still come to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After an overwhelmingly positive response from the community, Melendez continued his philanthropic mission to support businesses in need.

This week is $200 in gift cards for Olympia Family Diner.<\/p>\n<p>All together, Melendez has spent roughly $1,400 on giveaways to support regional restaurants, and the restaurateur has around $600 more to spend.

The use of ready-mix concrete became the base, frame, and canvas by which this tapestry was established,\u201d Alchemy Concrete Director of Development Charlie Wanty said of the property located north of Amherst.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPoured concrete was the base for the stone-veneered concrete entry columns with lighting, the stone-veneered concrete wall to the lake with steps and lighting, the artisan-poured concrete dragonfly table with stools, the in-concrete lighting in the entry drive, the motor court, and connecting walkways.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis project featured: stone-veneered concrete entry columns with brass-inlayed name and date-inset panels define the entry. The entry drive with slate-textured, stamped contrasting borders and stamped, colored slate panels leads to the slate-textured stamped contrasting borders and stamped slate panel motor court with an embossed, colored-concrete Weslaski medallion at the house entry and slate-textured colored walkway to the lakeside.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe layers that create the canvas of the \u201cLegacy\u201d are the specialty concrete uses throughout the site including the gateway columns, the driveway, the motor court, the Weslaski medallion, the connecting walk to the rear gathering area, the micro-topping \/texturing of existing steps, the addition of front\/side yard steps and stepping stone connection, the rear gathering area with inlayed dragonfly table and stools, the walk to the lake, and the lighted steps and wall to the lake.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wanty said that the project started out at about one-sixth of the size in which it was at completion, which created challenges due to its \u201cconstant evolution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alchemy also faced challenges in lake limitations, on-site storm water shedding, elevation changes, and reconstruction under high water levels.<\/p>\n<p>However, the finished product garnered awards from the Wisconsin Ready Mix Concrete Association (WRMCA) and Decorative Concrete Council (DCC.)<\/p>\n<p>The WRMCA awards program recognizes \u201cexcellence in the ready-mixed concrete industry\u201d on a state level, while the DCC program recognizes \u201coutstanding decorative concrete projects\u201d around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Wanty said that the awards \u201cReally showcases that we can do all aspects of decorative concrete. If our customer can dream it, we\u2019ll find a way to create it. We love these one of a kind, custom projects where we can collaborate with our clients to create one-of-a-kind projects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAwards and recognitions are great, but we truly are grateful for our customers who allow us to create amazing, beautiful, creative, and most importantly, functional outdoor spaces. We have a truly talented team that produces top notch work. We are thankful to have both an awesome staff and clients who value the type of work we love to create,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Alchemy Concrete was founded in 2004 by Judah Haas. The company works with all types of concrete construction, but sees decorative concrete as their core business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nelsonville business racking up awards<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":112995,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[2107,1271,10],"tags":[3303],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

We were having another record-breaking year underway; and then from nowhere, we were totally shut down, without any warning at all,\u201d recalled Joan Allen, who has owned Pinewood Supper Club with her husband for over four decades.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was extremely difficult, because there were a lot of things in the mix right here for us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The couple had just completed some major renovations and had placed large food orders for upcoming events.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they did the Safer at Home order and closed us down, we were left with all of this hanging, thousands and thousands of dollars of food that had just been delivered that morning. Things that we have been anticipating on paying for over the next month, that couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d Allen added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am also part of the restaurant association\u2026so I am unfortunate to hear some information ahead of time. This, obviously, we did not,\u201d Eric Freund, Sky Club Supper Club co-owner and Wisconsin Restaurant Association board member, said of the shutdown.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe week before we had our restaurant expo in Milwaukee \u2013 the week of (March) 4<sup>th<\/sup>, 5<sup>th<\/sup>, and 6<sup>th<\/sup>, I believe it was.<\/p>\n<p>The following week, the business was preparing for spring break and St. Patrick\u2019s Day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all woke up on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and I think it was about 1 p.m., or maybe it was 3 p.m., in the afternoon and all of the sudden, boom, we were all shut down. I think that everyone was in disbelief trying to figure out what was happening, and we were all scared because nobody knew what was happening at that point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>The transition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_112840\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112840\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-112840\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"John Ross\" width=\"410\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/NEWS-Supper-Clubs-1-201223.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-112840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Ross of Savory Steakhouse had just purchased the fine dining establishment and built up a strong customer base when everything was shut down. Kris Leonhardt photo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Freund, whose family has owned the Sky Club since 1961, said that the next issue was figuring about how to transition into a viable sales model.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we as a supper club \u2013 fine dining \u2013 transition to a carry-out system. From our standpoint, well we do carry-out fish frys, but that is it. From a fine dining standpoint, we were like what are we supposed to do; we have steak, seafood, a salad bar. We were just lost,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>The Sky Club then completely modified their menu and made adjustments day by day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a non-drive through business, like fast casual, I could say like Culver\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s, they are used to this drive-through system of food service. Well, you start getting us independents\u2026,\u201d Freund said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first week we probably had 50 plus cars in our parking lot waiting for food.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a matter of nine days, the business instituted an online ordering system, retooled their menu, and developed a system that worked for them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe really wanted to make family-style dinners in that early part of COVID, because we were trying to feed families,\u201d Freund said.<\/p>\n<p>But Freund says that even with the transition to carry out, the business had dropped 50-60 percent in sales.<\/p>\n<p>But, he wasn\u2019t alone.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to reinvent what we do,\u201d Allen said<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe figured out some kind of carry-out strategy for us, because we are a supper club. We are only open in the evenings. We are located on the outskirts of Mosinee. We are not a typical carry-out kind of place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>John Ross of Savory Steakhouse had just purchased the fine dining establishment and built up a strong customer base when everything was shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Ross recalled that carry-out orders were slow to come at first.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen, Fridays and Saturdays started picking up,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it became like, I\u2019ve got a good base here; which I was shocked, because I\u2019m so new.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSomewhere around early April to mid-April it became apparent to me that I actually do have a base and they are really trying to support the restaurant, so I could get through COVID.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opening up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe (were) just trying to figure out how to move forward, to keep our community safe and also to feed them; and also to support our staff who have been here for 25 years,\u201d Freund said.<\/p>\n<p>As information came out, the Sky Club began preparing for a reopening which they were able to move to in late May at a much smaller capacity and with many more precautions.<\/p>\n<p>As the doors opened, supper clubs were now seeing couples and groups of two, instead larger groups, in a socially-spaced setting, as well as operating during fewer hours.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we came back, instead of the full six night a week, (we were open) only four nights a week and our hours were cut a little bit,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cWe started serving just Wednesday through Saturday, and we were able to establish enough business on Wednesday and Thursday to remain open, and then the weekend was fairly good. But, we are doing one-third of the volume that we\u2019ve done previously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ongoing issues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the most devastating feeling was when the Supreme Court lifted the order, and I opened back up,\u201d Ross recalled. \u201cI had two weeks of zero customers. Take-out orders, 100 percent disappeared. I had nothing, no take-out orders, no customers. That was a dark period, very dark.<\/p>\n<p>Ross said that he was not alone and some of his colleagues were experiencing the same.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am missing a huge demographic and that demographic is the 60 and older crowd,\u201d Ross said.<\/p>\n<p>Ross said that his sales have been cut by over half of what it was when he was operating at full speed, which forces him to lay off his high school employees so he can keep his full-time workers \u201cwith mortgages\u201d employed.<\/p>\n<p>But as they enter what is typically the busiest time period for supper clubs, they are doing it in a mode that will keep workers employed and customers safe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to change our entire philosophy and our entire menu, and we became creative,\u201d Freund added, while reminding us that we are all in this together.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt CENTRAL WISCONSIN \u2013 Supper clubs are deeply rooted in Wisconsin culture.

If approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the upcoming weeks, Trig\u2019s is expecting millions of doses to be released countrywide before the end of the year. Some of those will be delivered to Trig\u2019s pharmacy to administer to Phase IA patients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were approached to do this\u2026 We do quite a bit of vaccination out of our pharmacies, both within the pharmacy and we go outside and do local area clinics and things like that in our market areas,\u201d said Jeff Suppon, Trig\u2019s director of pharmacy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, when the prospect of having pharmacies being providers of this vaccine (arose), it was just kind of a no brainer. We already had the platform to do that and pretty much everyone on our staff is a vaccinator. We had the means to do it, so I wanted to make sure that we were an outlet for the community, when it came time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Suppon said that eventually all Trig\u2019s pharmacies will have the vaccine, but it could take until spring of 2021 for widespread availability, as it will be administered in phases.<\/p>\n<p>The phases<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese first phases, they are really only going to be available to places that service long-term care facilities and health care workers,\u201d Suppon said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we kind of had a unique availability of the vaccine, because we do service some of those places \u2013 long-term care facilities \u2013 in some of our market areas. So, that gave us an opportunity to get it ahead of some other places.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, it won\u2019t be available in all of our stores right away, but eventually it will. When it is more regularly dispersed amongst the community, we will have it in all of our stores.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Phase IA for vaccine administration will include healthcare workers, long-term care facilities, and potentially their residents.<\/p>\n<p>Phase IB will address \u201ccritical workers,\u201d which looks to include food service places, high traffic business institutions, and the high-risk population.<\/p>\n<p>A Phase IC would be age-based, addressing the elderly population first.<\/p>\n<p>The next phase would address the general population.<\/p>\n<p>Suppon added that these phases are a framework and regulations are in the process of being clearly defined, and it is not clear how quickly the progression will advance through the phases, as it is unknown how much vaccine will be available.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight up front, there is only going to be a very limited amount, because not every manufacturer is having their vaccine approved right away. As it is approved, it will be distributed. At the beginning it will be slow and the rate will pick up as more vaccines become available,\u201d Suppon explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe first vaccine \u2013 Pfizer \u2013 is on the table the 10<sup>th<\/sup> of December to be looked at for approval, so I am assuming that it will move pretty quickly upon review at that date; and then, we will start to see (it.) I fully expect it to be before the end of the year, but we could be looking at the third week in December to actually have the vaccine to administer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be a limited supply, allocated. It is not something that we purchase; we get what we get. But, we are in line to receive vaccine to administer to those specific Phase IA people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Monitoring effects<\/p>\n<p>Suppon said that the pharmacy is under strict guidelines on monitoring the effects of the vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a very, very strict requirement for follow up with side effects monitoring, reporting. There are strict guidelines that we have to be in compliance with to be enrolled and also to be accepted and granted access to this part of the vaccine,\u201d Suppon said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are quite a few measures to follow up on with our patients. They will have information that will go with them that will let them know, or any entities that they go to. So, it is another healthcare provider or something like that, they will have a vaccination card that will come along that says they got the vaccine and it was this particular one, they got it on this date, this is when they are due for the next one. Then, they will have all of our information to maintain contact with us, so that we can go through those processes of monitoring side effects and things like that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Suppon said that safety and trial data look good right now, but the country is still in the learning phase with the vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsually, we learn that stuff well in advance before vaccines come out.

Our biggest customers are companies like Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Disney, Abrams, Simon &amp; Schuster; that\u2019s the vast majority of the business we do. We also do a lot of books for smaller printers; that\u2019s well under 20 percent of our overall activity,\u201d explained Worzalla President\/CEO Jim Fetherston.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe largest publishers in the world are our best customers, which is really kind of cool because these are publishers that are global in scale, and they do print books all over the world. Yet, for the North American market, when they have really important books that they want to get out into the marketplace, they choose Worzalla in Stevens Point.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like to make the point that we are two hours from anything in any direction\u2026 We\u2019re not the easiest place to get to, but isn\u2019t it amazing that these publishers that print all over the world, like China and Asia and Europe, bring some of their most important and high profile projects to us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Worzalla produces some of the most well-known books on the market today.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe types of titles we do, which is part of our claim to fame, is we do a lot of what in the industry is called trade work, which are best sellers \u2013 the fiction novels and the non-fiction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company also does a lot of children\u2019s books; cook books; movie tie-in books, including the Marvel franchise and Star Wars; and lifestyle books, such as gardening and home improvement.<\/p>\n<p>One of their most notable products is the \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d series.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur books are kind of like keepsake books; they are not the kind of books that you read once toss them\u2026 You keep them. You put them on your coffee table, you put them on your book shelf, and you keep them around; because, they tell a story about you as the buyer that this is one of your interests,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>Through these products, Worzalla has stood the test of time, in an industry that has stood the test of time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody thought that books were going to go the path music, which was to an electronic format and away from hard media, So, we like to say in our industry that \u2018on the way to our funeral a funny thing happened, we refused to die,\u2019\u201d Fetherston said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle and all of the big technology companies have spent fortunes developing tablet devices to prompt children to read and do all kinds of cool things. I can\u2019t say that they are bad and didn\u2019t work, but they didn\u2019t end up replacing the age-old toddler crawling up on their parents lap with a book and going through the pages together repetitively, to the point where the kid can\u2019t read but has memorized the dialogue on every page.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part 6 in Worzalla Series: The products<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":112509,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1271,1155,10],"tags":[3153],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -
