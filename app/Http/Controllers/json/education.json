initially graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Julian Hahn struggled to find fulfilling employment afterward, working a couple of different jobs in one-year spurts each, one as a manager, another in software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, try as he might, each job he worked offered Hahn less and less fulfillment with time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, every failure ultimately leads one to where they\u2019re meant to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Hahn, this meant reconnecting with his nature-loving roots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI kinda grew up doing a lot of camping and outdoors stuff,\u201d said Hahn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the pandemic, Hahn had spent much of his free time surrounded by nature, escaping the stresses of everyday life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would just go camping every weekend,\u201d Hahn said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, on lockdown in his parents\u2019 cabin and surrounded by nature, Hahn had the opportunity to connect with himself and the world around him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discovering a budding interest in trees, Hahn picked up a tree identification guide to study in his downtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not until he found a job listing for a forestry position while browsing for jobs that Hahn realized the possibility of making a living off of a lifelong passion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though he did not possess the qualifications at the time for the position, Hahn decided to return to school, this time with an arboreal focus in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in his senior year, Hahn is a member of several varied organizations on and around campus, including the Society of American Foresters, the UWSP Fire Crew and the Student Society of Arboriculture (SSA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While he joined each club to give him an idea of what he might like to do in a professional setting, he found that the SSA\u2019s activities resonated with him most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI kinda fell in love with climbing trees,\u201d Hahn said of the club, which sees its members climbing and pruning trees around campus using equipment rented from the school stockroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt just opened my eyes that this was a viable option [for a career].\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once he graduates in May, Hahn has a job lined up with lawn and tree care company SavATree in Madison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This follows a successful internship with the company in the Twin Cities last summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, of course, once he\u2019s obtained a bit more experience in the field, he thinks it would be \u201cpretty awesome\u201d to begin a tree care business of his own, one that allows him to utilize his business degree and knowledge of arboriculture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, if he\u2019s not tending trees on campus as the pruning coordinator of the SSA, he can be found spending time with his pitbull, Tully, who is only too happy to drag him outdoors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kana Coonce Contributing Writer STEVENS POINT \u2013 After years of planting seeds in several fields, a senior at

better understand race relations. <strong>UW-Stevens Point photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By Kris Leonhardt<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>STEVENS POINT \u2013 Race relations expert, Daryl Davis, 65, shared his quest for positive change to a packed theater in the UW-Stevens Point Dreyfus University Center on Feb. 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis has spent four decades connecting with Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist group leaders to answer the question, \u201cHow can you hate me when you don\u2019t even know me?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis said that he wasn\u2019t exposed to racism until the age of 10 and that was when he formed that question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy parents were in the U.S. Foreign Service. And so that means I grew up as an American Embassy brat traveling all around the world starting at the age of three in 1961,\u201d Davis recalled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd my first exposure to school was overseas. How it works is you get assigned to a country for two years, and then you come back home here to you here for a few months, perhaps a year if you request it, and then you\u2019re back overseas again to another country for two years, back and forth, back and forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI did kindergarten, first grade, third grade, fifth grade, seventh grade, all in different countries. And my classes overseas were filled with kids from all over the world. If they had an embassy where we were assigned, their kids went to the same school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy classmates were from Nigeria, Japan, Poland, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, anybody that had an embassy there, all of their children were to the same school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery time I\u2019d come back home, I would either be an all black or black and white school, meaning the still segregated or the newly integrated. And just because desegregation was passed by the Supreme Court for years before I was born in 1954, schools did not integrate overnight. It took years and years for schools to integrate, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, one of the times when I came back here, I was age 10 in 1968, in the fourth grade, and I went to a newly integrated school in which I was one of two black children in the entire school.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, Davis joined the Cub Scouts along with his male friends<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was the only black scout in the area. This is in Belmont, Massachusetts, which is a suburb of Boston. And we had a parade there right next door to Belmont is the town of Lexington, Massachusetts. We had a parade it was a Cub Scouts, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the Brownies, 4-H clubs and some other organizations. It\u2019s called Patriots Day and we march from Lexington to Concord, Massachusetts, to commemorate the \u2018Ride of Paul Revere,\u2019\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, the streets are blocked off. The sidewalks on either side are lined with nothing but white people waving and cheering and having a good time. And everybody\u2019s smiling. Some people are yelling, \u2019The British\u2019 are coming and that kind of thing until we got to a certain point in the parade route. When suddenly, boom, I\u2019m getting hit with bottles and soda pop cans by a few people over on the sidewalk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNot everybody was doing this. I would say maybe four or five people I remember there being a couple of kids, maybe a year or two older than me. I did not know them and a couple of adults who were throwing things. I assumed maybe it was their parents, but it\u2019s coming from my right side over on the sidewalk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd, when it happened, having never had any previous experience with this, I had no precedent for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was the only Scout getting hit until my den mother, my cub master, my troop leader all came running back and huddled over me with their bodies and quickly escorted me out of the danger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd I kept asking \u2018Why are they doing this? I didn\u2019t do anything to them. What did I do? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u2019 And so I\u2019m trying to you know, figure out I\u2019m trying to justify why they\u2019re doing this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That encounter led him on a 40-year search for an answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis said that he met those individuals that seek to hate him with civility, patience and listening, in an effort to understand and effect positive change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs human beings, we want these five core values in our lives: everybody wants to be loved; everybody wants to be respected; everybody wants to be heard; everybody wants to be treated fairly and truthfully; everybody wants the same things for their family as we want for our family,\u201d Davis explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if we can learn to apply those five core values or any of those values when we find ourselves in an adversarial situation or in a society or culture in which we are uncomfortable or unfamiliar, I can guarantee you that our navigation of that situation, that culture, that society will be much more smooth and much more positive. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to navigate my conversations with people who are the polar opposites of me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davis said that he believes that a missed opportunity for dialogue is a missed opportunity for resolution and that sitting around casting blame wastes time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour society, your city, your country can only become one of two things \u2013 one, what you sit back and watch it become, or two, that which you stand and make it become. So, you have to ask yourselves a question, do I want to sit back and see what my country becomes or do I want to stand up and make my country become what I want to see?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI chose the latter.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Race relations expert shares quest for understanding By Kris Leonhardt Editor STEVENS POINT \u2013 Race relations expert, Daryl Davis, 65, shared his quest for positive change to a packed theater in the UW-Stevens Point Dreyfus University Center on Feb. 15.

Wisconsin, and the county board\u2019s Diversity Affairs and Inclusiveness Committee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have loved this community since the first day I arrived for school at UWSP in 2005.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I have my own kids attending school here, I made the decision it was time to get more involved in the future of their education, and for me the best way to do that is by going right to the source, the local school board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why are you running for this office and what do you hope to accomplish:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our children are our future, and in that reality I find that school is one of the most influential establishments in their young lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes their schooling and the institution of schooling extremely important to the success of the child, and ultimately the greater society at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overseers of that system serve a very important role in the continuation of such an important facet of societal development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As life would have it a large portion of the current civic volunteer population is aging and getting ready to pass the baton to the new leaders and volunteers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, society never seems to get less busy and the free time available for civic volunteerism becomes exponentially more difficult but never less important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt compelled to step up and start receiving the historical knowledge needed to usher in the next cohort of leaders, and to offer my breadth of knowledge to create a well-rounded and diverse set of ideas, opinions, and solutions for the District.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am at a point in life where I have a good work-life-play balance that affords me the ability to serve on a School Board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a parent, a community member, a former student, a tax payer, and a believer in the importance of quality education it is my desire to offer my service and time to help contribute to the continuation of an amazing school district for future students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the top three issues facing the Stevens Point Area School District and how would you approach addressing them:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teacher retention and attraction is one of the top priorities, and top issues facing our school district.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the demographic climate changing every year, and the job market in a constant flux, it has become increasingly difficult to attract and retain good teachers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a task that will be solved by any single person, board, or solution but rather will need a continuous diverse set of ever changing solutions adapted to the sweeping changes in our community, society, and job market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest initial solution in addressing these issues is to welcome the teachers and staff into the board room to hear their input on what their challenges are and what they might recommend as solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another top priority in the district would be to address the learning loss both pre and post-COVID related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not hard to find a study showing that US education overall is lagging behind financially comparable Nations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to work creatively as a board to identify ways to close the learning gap for all students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least we need to address the looming financial and demographic difficulties headed our way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no secret that less children are being born, less teachers are coming out of college, more competition is entering the schooling arena, costs are increasing for everything, and the political climate surrounding public education has never been more divisive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;All these factors are interrelated and need to be openly discussed by all stakeholders sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A proactive approach versus a reactive approach will help create more meaningful and lasting solutions that serve everyone\u2019s interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My approach to addressing these topics is to make the public aware of the issues and invite them to our Board meetings to hear their opinions and solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A board is there to represent the greater community but the community\u2019s input is still valid and needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t imagine these conversations will be without their share of criticism, skepticism, and distrust but open conversations among board members and the community will help better prepare all community stake holders of the headwinds the district faces, and allow the community to be a part of the solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2

Almost every school district in Wisconsin is facing a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d this year and the next. As we look for ways to save money we also have to confront the real problem that Wisconsin schools are slowly being financially squeezed.&nbsp; The cost is coming due.&nbsp; We have the money in the state now to help, without raising taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c. The staff in our schools have actually lost earning power in the last 20 years.\u00a0 People are not going into teaching and they are leaving teaching such that we are having positions going unfilled.\u00a0 This situation is only getting worse.\u00a0 We need to do something about this if we want to continue to offer our students effective education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Christina Scott<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please share a brief biography of your education, background and life experiences that qualify you to take a leadership role serving on the Stevens Point Area School District Board:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have lived and worked in Stevens Point for over 20 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My son attended most of his school years here.

I have worked with a variety of different stakeholders in education to achieve positive outcomes for students. I also have my masters in education (with certifications in principalship and director of curriculum and instruction) which provide me other lenses to see education through and better assist students and staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why are you running for this office and what do you hope to accomplish:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to run for school board because I, as a parent, community member, current middle school\/high school teacher, and as someone holding a master\u2019s degree in educational administration with certification in curriculum, realized that my point of view can benefit the Stevens Point School District. I have the ability to view things from many different angles. With that ability, I can assist our district in moving forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the top three issues facing the Stevens Point Area School District and how would you approach addressing them:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first item that is greatly affecting our district is our turnover of employees. I have heard from multiple teachers that they feel unheard by the school board. This is a recurring theme that has been voiced at board meetings as well, yet unsolved. Teachers are frustrated with what they are being asked to teach, outside of their curricular area. It is too vital that these positions are not understaffed as they provide education and safety for our children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second area we should look at is students who are open enrolling in other districts rather than remaining within ours. As a district, we have to make sure that we aren\u2019t losing kids to other districts but are retaining all of our students. According to the 2020-21 school budget (Third Friday count), the district is down 240 students from last year. This is a significant number, and an area to address. We need to reach out to them and see why they are leaving and address that within our schools so we aren\u2019t losing these students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This problem goes into the third thing which needs to be addressed: the budget. On account of the loss of students, our funding is also going down. We have to make sure that we are using all of the tax dollars we receive to the best of our abilities.&nbsp; If we continue to spend at the rate we are right now, we will need to pass another referendum. We need to be wise financial stewards. The funds entrusted to us need to be utilized with student achievement and educational outcomes as the priority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ted Kowalski<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please share a brief biography of your education, background and life experiences that qualify you to take a leadership role serving on the Stevens Point Area School District Board:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/FP-School-Candidates-2-230217.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Kowalski\" class=\"wp-image-118026\" width=\"227\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/FP-School-Candidates-2-230217.jpg 512w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/FP-School-Candidates-2-230217-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/FP-School-Candidates-2-230217-400x500.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/FP-School-Candidates-2-230217-480x600.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong>Kowalski<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I am a UW-Madison graduate and have lived in the Stevens Point School district for over 30 years.

Business Affairs has provided regular updates of our finances and training to help our university colleagues better understand the budgeting process.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UW-Stevens Point will also focus on serving both the internal and external communities for \u201cthe greatest impact.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA university-wide committee will be established to promote campus climate, community health and overall well-being,\u201d Gibson said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other strategies are focused on \u201cserving our students in enhancing our institution\u2019s success.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cIntentional, impactful, innovative, that is what we strive for through purpose-driven education as we live out our mission,\u201d Gibson added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat is what energizes us to do our best in our professions and guides us to inspire our students to succeed as a top regional public institution in the state and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUW-Stevens Point is a leader and partner in solving problems and addressing issues locally, regionally, and statewide. This may happen quietly behind the scenes, or it may involve collaborators publicly or privately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur intrinsic obligation is to help meet community needs. We are committed to being a steward of place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTake for example our doctor of physical therapy program which launched last summer, North Central Wisconsin population is older with a greater incidence of heart pain related in cerebrovascular diseases. Yet the number of licensed physical therapists per 100,000 residents is about half of what it is in southern Wisconsin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur College of Professional Studies team worked with health care providers and other professionals for nearly eight years, planning how to best address this need.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Wisconsin Forestry Center at UWSP is receiving a State Workforce Innovation Grant of $8 million. The grant will support education and help to create a pipeline to forestry careers for the next generation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe grid brings together a coalition of partners in industry, education and economic development. All across Wisconsin, hundreds of homeowners have benefited from the expertise at the water and environmental analysis lab. The lab has collected and analyzed more than 125 wells samples in its 50 years of existence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis outreach and leadership has extended to every corner of Wisconsin, helping state residents to verify drinking water quality.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gibson also relayed that UW-Stevens Point had implemented a university diversity plan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA university diversity plan will be introduced following reviews by shared governance and university cabinet. The plan outlines institutional objectives and strategies in four areas \u2013 institutional commitment, student success, campus climate and education,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enrollment and collaboration on branch campuses will also be addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re also partnering with our branch campus executives to grow enrollment, exploring new collaborations with school districts and business leaders in the region. Our branch campuses are critical to expanding educational access to students and we are committed to their success,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gibson also applauded the UW-Stevens Point staff for their commitment to providing a purpose-driven education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI see them grow personally and professionally. They are transformed during their time at each of our campuses. They are transformed by what they learned in the classroom and lab by the co-curricular activities and hands-on learning experiences,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy the opportunities they didn\u2019t even know existed before they became a pointer, they are prepared to reimagine and make an impactful difference in their world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis purpose-driven education is important, life-changing work and we cannot do it without each of you. So let\u2019s continue to be intentional, impactful and innovative and 2023.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UW-Stevens Point Chancellor Gibson gives State of the University Address By Kris Leonhardt Editor STEVENS POINT \u2013 On Jan. 19, UW-Stevens Point Chancellor Tom Gibson gave his State of the University Address in Michelsen Hall of the Noel Fine Arts Center, where he imparted the college\u2019s 2022 accomplishments and impact and plans for 2023.

But it is difficult to train on interpersonal dynamics, on communication effectiveness, on critical thinking and complex problem solving; that they need folks who can work in diverse environments who can communicate effectively, and all of those skills that are developed during an undergraduate education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hard for an employer in our region to train on all of that compared to some of their in-house job duties.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll students are required to take three credits in a course that satisfies the critical thinking learning outcome,\u201d explained UWSP Critical Thinking Center Director Dona Warren. \u201cThat course can be offered in pretty much whatever discipline, as long as the instructors have been internally certified to teach such a course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe do expect our instructors who teach these courses to go through some workshops, just so they understand the critical thinking framework, that we use our definitions and talk a little bit about the skills and the best way to integrate those skills in their courses.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university defines critical thinking as \u201cthe process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating and constructing reasoning in deciding what conclusions to draw, or actions to take.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UW-Green Bay\u2019s general education program provides an \u201cinterdisciplinary, problem-focused educational experience that prepares students to think critically and address complex issues.\u201d This includes developing skills that include communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and quantitative and information literacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking it a step further, UWGB offers a Modern Workplace Skills Noncredit Certificate which includes a module gaining an understanding of situational analysis and problem-solving skills, in which students delve into the dynamics of decision-making and fine-tune their critical thinking skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warren said that the need for this skill set is not new, but the approach to addressing it is for some colleges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEmployers have been asking for this for a long time \u2013 the desire for critical thinking among employees,\u201d she stated. \u201cAnd critical thinking has been an important concept in educational circles at least since the 80s.

It is an affirmation of the confidence Sentry has in UW-Stevens Point.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>McPartland said Sentry recognizes a strong university is paramount to developing a skilled workforce and talent pipeline for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This new initiative builds on the company\u2019s successful partnership in developing UW-Stevens Point\u2019s data analytics program. Sentry also created the Sentry IT Co-op downtown, employing UW-Stevens Point students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt Sentry, we firmly believe the presence of a strong university is critical, not only for our company but for the community,\u201d McPartland added. \u201cAs a Fortune 650 company, headquartered in a small midwestern city, we\u2019re able to thrive due in large part to UW-Stevens Point. The university is creating career-ready graduates and contributing to a community culture that allows us to recruit and retain well educated, talented employees.

It will include an entrepreneurship center and Center for Women\u2019s Equity, Development and Leadership, serving both UW-Stevens Point students and the community. Experiential learning will occur through the Anderson Classroom to Career Center,\u201d a UWSP release stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe School of Business and Economics has experienced significant growth in the past eight years with Sentry\u2019s support and partnership. In 2016, Sentry provided a gift of $4 million to create a major in data analytics and endow two new faculty positions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlso in 2016, the School of Business and Economics received accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. In 2019, a master of business administration (MBA) in applied leadership and decision making was launched at all three UW-Stevens Point campuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cA stand-alone business school will raise the visibility of the program with regional businesses and will elevate the profile of the school for prospective students and partners. With the additional resources and renovated facilities, university leaders hope to double enrollment.

Loomis went from \u201cundecided\u201d in the College of Business to becoming an environmental studies major in the College of Letters and Science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA major that may be thought of as untraditional and less practical had grabbed my attention,\u201d Loomis said, adding that she gained urban farmer training while working in the Harvest Room with its numerous hydroponics growing units at Reeve Memorial Union.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local source of fresh food is part of the University\u2019s sustainability mission. Warzynski taught Loomis to monitor water quality, manage plant growth and harvest lettuce and various culinary herbs for the campus catering program. Hundreds of pounds of food were harvested every week and she was trained on some of the newest models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alumna notes that today she is the urban farm manager of a nonprofit in Manitowoc County with more than double the number of Fork Farms hydroponic units than she worked with in the UW Oshkosh Harvest Room. The lettuce harvested serves hundreds of people experiencing food insecurity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would not have met this achievement if (Warzynski) had not introduced me to the Harvest Room and encouraged me to learn more about hydroponics,\u201d Loomis said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Going the extra mile<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dylan Bram, program adviser for Reeve Union Board, Late Night Programming and Titan Underground events, said Warzynski has a creative mind and is able to come up with amazing food selections for themed events and stay within a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBrian has developed a place where students learn how to run a small-scale restaurant, customer service skills and health code policies, and it\u2019s a place where they want to work,\u201d Bram said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Warzynski listens to students, gives them feedback and coaches them within the restaurant and with life\u2014helping them develop into good people with lifelong skills and a strong work ethic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Surprise honor<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warzynski said the award was something that he figured out about halfway through a banquet he was attending with other UWO leaders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI feel honored about winning the award,\u201d he said. \u201cIt confirms the hard work and it makes you want to do even better.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He credited all of the staff in Reeve with making \u201cthe magic happen\u201d and coming through on some of the tougher ideas he\u2019s come up with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince coming to this campus, my vision and goal is \u2018how can I make it better for the students? They are the ones who employ me and I don\u2019t want to let them down,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind I want to be a leader in the dining program so that students from our campus tell others how great it is to be here, how much we care for them and build a culture of family and belonging.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warzynski said his student employees are like family and he wants to get to know them and hear about their great moments in school and the not-so-great moments. He works to provide building blocks and opportunities to grow\u2014even if it means learning from mistakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese are challenging times we live in and I want to give them all of the tools to succeed when they leave here,\u201d Warzynski said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Laurie Schlosser For the Gazette OSHKOSH &#8212; A student who needed help finding a career path is crediting the assistant director of dining operations at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh with providing just the right support.

We wanted to project it out into the world somehow, and there came along an opportunity to be considered to be a sponsor for a PGA golf tournament in Maui called the \u2018Tournament of Champions.\u2019<br><br>\u201c We recognized, frankly, immediately that that was a better golf tournament for us to attach ourselves to than any on the mainland, and we saw the potential immediately from a branding standpoint and from an opportunity to engage with our customer base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis turned out to be perfect and then some.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t see coming, however, was how close we would find ourselves becoming to the island of Maui and the people who live in Maui.

With the support of Chancellor Dreyfus, many state and federal agencies and even the father of Earth Day himself, Senator Gaylord Nelson.

The goal of the program is to increase the number of state residents who graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree and therefore have greater potential to improve their lives, their family lives, and their respective communities. This program is especially aimed at first generation students and those from low to moderate income families throughout Wisconsin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbout 47 percent of UW-Stevens Point students are the first in their families to attend college \u2013 one-third are Pell eligible, indicating exceptional financial need. The Wisconsin Tuition Promise will provide up to four years of tuition and fees and it will also support students whose families earn less than $62,000 annually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose eligible will be first-time enrollees or transfers who attend a UW institution full time; this includes our campuses in Stevens Point, Wausau, and Marshfield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWisconsin Tuition Promise is also a step forward toward driving economic and social mobility for Wisconsin residents, because 92 percent of UW-Stevens Point graduates live in Wisconsin at least three years after graduation. We know our communities in our state benefit from a strong workforce, and certainly an educated citizenry. The timing aligns well for those planning for fall 2023. The admissions application for next fall just opened on Aug.1 for UW Stevens Point.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rothman said that the state is in a \u201cwar for talent.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know we see that in the media. But more importantly, we\u2019re seeing that from employers,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe live in a global market for talent. And if Wisconsin succeeds, in graduating more people with undergraduate degrees and graduate degrees, we\u2019re going to be able to fill that gap that currently exists that our employers are desperately looking for more employees with those credentials. If we succeed, Wisconsin wins. If we don\u2019t succeed in filling that gap, we all lose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe UW system is moving now to try to address those workforce needs of the future. That Tuition Promise, quite frankly, is an investment in our future in our state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the same way that we invest in infrastructure and we build bridges and roads and sewers and water lines. This is an investment in human capital, that we will all benefit from throughout society.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tuition Promise is designed to provide \u201clast dollar financial support,\u201d after federal and state grant aid is taken into account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, visit wisconsin.edu\/tuition-promise.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Katelyn Voorhies\/Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 UW System President Jay Rothman joined UW-Stevens Point Chancellor Thomas Gibson on Aug. 16 at UWSP to announce a new initiative to make college education more affordable in Wisconsin.

showed that 85 percent of students felt safe at school, while 23 percent believed that violence was an issue at their school \u2013 that\u2019s nearly one in four students that view potential threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those high schools surveyed include Assumption, Auburndale, Columbus Catholic, Port Edwards, Lincoln, Marshfield, Nekoosa, and Pittsville.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, state officials are also aware of this potential for violence and are working to give communities the tools to avoid and handle such situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Justice Office of School Safety Director Trish Kilpin said that state officials have intervened in plans by nearly 70 students to attack schools in some manner in recent years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speak Up, Speak Out<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, Kilpin visited Wausau to work with central Wisconsin school districts to conduct violence prevention training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot prevent violence from occurring alone,&#8221; Kilpin said during a press conference. &#8220;If parents, students or bystanders become aware that a child may be behaving in ways that suggest that they could engage in violence, then we need to know about that, and they need to trust us, so that we can assess the information and develop an appropriate plan.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the department\u2019s \u2018Speak Up, Speak Out\u2019 initiative, a tipline was created to report threats, violence, and self-harm in a more low-key manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students, parents, school staff, and community members can submit concerns via <a href=\"https:\/\/speakup.widoj.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/speakup.widoj.go<\/a>v or 1-800-697-8761.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improvements to response<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July, the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of School Safety (OSS) announced grant funding which offered reimbursement through the Wisconsin Act 109 Digital Mapping of School Buildings program for 2022. The funding reimburses school boards and private school leadership for critical incident mapping, which provides a layout of school facilities for immediate access by local law enforcement. This provides officers and deputies with a layout of the school in the event of a life-threatening situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCritical incident mapping data can help first responders get to the location of a critical incident as quickly as possible,\u201d Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in response to the release of funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Wisconsin\u2019s Act 143 required school boards and private school leadership to submit blueprints of the school, but Act 109 amended it to allow for critical incident mapping data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cState law requires each school board and the governing body of each private school, to have a school<br>safety plan in effect, and to review and approve that plan at least once every three years after it goes into effect. Upon creating the plan, and upon each subsequent review, the board or governing body must submit a copy of the most recent blueprints of the school to the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the school and to the Office of School Safety (OSS) at the Wisconsin Department of<br>Justice (DOJ). The OSS must coordinate with schools to compile and keep confidential all blueprints,<br>unless a law enforcement agency requests access,\u201d a Wisconsin Legislative Council memo stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legislative actions ensure that first responders to school situations are able to pinpoint locations within the buildings, as well as the surrounding areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>School Staff Training<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Stevens Point School District, district officials and staff have taken resources from the\u201d I Love U Guys Foundation\u201d and implemented them in their facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe founders, their daughter was killed in a school shooting in 2006. They literally quit their jobs and started a foundation,\u201d explained Chris Budzinski, Stevens Point school district facilities &amp; safety manager.<br>\u201cEssentially their mission statement is \u2018to restore and protect the joy of youth through educational programs and positive actions in collaboration with families, schools, communities, organizations, and government entities,\u2019 to make sure schools are prepared for any sort of response \u2013 anything from a chlorine spill&#8230;to the worst case scenario.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo it&#8217;s just a powerful moving story that started it. One of the other founders, four of her kids were in Sandy Hook when that happened. So, it&#8217;s really an experienced foundation that was put together across the United States (with) programs that are free to users, being schools, churches, communities, all sorts of things. What to do in case of tragedy, or just regular response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"School Safety Training\" class=\"wp-image-117434\" width=\"465\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-400x225.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817-1066x600.jpg 1066w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-School-Training-2-220817.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" \/><figcaption>The I Love U Guys Foundation provides seminars and workshops in the Standard Response Protocol and the Standard Reunification Method. <strong>I Love U Guys Foundation photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;ve already invented the wheel. Let&#8217;s just start using what they&#8217;ve got.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For several years, Standard Response Protocols have been in place in the Stevens Point school district.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStandard Response Protocol is really action based. It&#8217;s what schools should use in case of a variety of things. There are five steps,\u201d Budzinski explained. \u201cThey have a \u2018hold,\u2019 which is essentially you&#8217;d stay in your room and get out of the hallways. You&#8217;d use this if, say, someone was having a medical emergency in the hallway. Well, you don&#8217;t want other people around; it&#8217;s kind of a private matter. You just have people go into response, stay in your classroom, no big deal business as usual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThen they have a \u2018secure,\u2019 which is kind of the second level of turning up a notch, like there&#8217;s probably, say, there&#8217;s crime happening around the school. It doesn&#8217;t affect the school, but you just don&#8217;t want people outside. So you go inside the building, make sure everything&#8217;s secured. All your doors are locked. Business back as usual, just doing school; but, you\u2019re back in the school. There&#8217;s just something outside the building affecting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, the next level is lockdown, if there&#8217;s a threat inside of the school, you go into a lockdown, which is literally locked door lights out; you know, get out of sight of the door and sit there and wait.<br><br>\u201cThen, they also have another action level which is \u2018evacuate,\u2019 which is something like a leak in the water main at the school and it\u2019s starting to flood. Then you&#8217;d evacuate the school or during the event of say an active shooter, you know, if you have a chance to get out of the building go. They talk about self evacuation, stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd the last one is \u2018shelter,\u2019 which would be some sort of weather phenomenon. Say, a tornado coming you need to shelter in place, stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo that&#8217;s kind of the breakdown of the standard response protocol. It&#8217;s action based on what you\u2019ve got to do based on just five actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schools implement the protocol twice a year, just like a fire drill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy goal is five years from now it\u2019s just second nature,\u201d Budzinski explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New for the upcoming school year is the Standard Reunification Method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cReunification is the second part,\u201d Budzinski said. \u201cWhat do you do in case of some sort of emergency? How do you get students reunited back with their families?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow do you make sure students are back with the right parents? That&#8217;s pretty easy if you&#8217;re doing it at the school, but if you&#8217;ve got to evacuate the building and say there&#8217;s seven teachers overwhelmed by like chlorine and all sudden they&#8217;re not with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe district office is going to be executing this reunification plan to make sure kids get with their parents\u2026 it&#8217;s a big drawn out process, but it&#8217;s the right path to go through to make sure everybody is accounted for and reunited with the right people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSome of the stuff you can\u2019t control. We can control this part, so let\u2019s do it. No matter the nature of what happens, we know we can put a process together to calm what we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s split seconds that saves time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think that one of our biggest gains this year is really putting a new emphasis in partnering with local law enforcement, first responders and having those relationships kind of figure out let&#8217;s get those back on track, making sure we&#8217;re working well together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, we just want to make sure in community that we&#8217;re all working together towards the same goal of keeping kids and staff and everybody in the community safe. Isn\u2019t that what we all want in life is to be safe, left alone to prosper and love our neighbors?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt CENTRAL WISCONSIN \u2013 While central Wisconsin students feel relatively safe inside area schools, many say that they\u2019re aware of the potential for violence.

It sort of came out of the devastation of Japan,\u201d explained UWSP Director of Suzuki Programs Ann Marie Novak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDr. Suzuki \u2013 Shinichi Suzuki \u2013 was rehearsing with his quartet. And one day, he just stopped a rehearsal and he said, \u2018you know, all Japanese children speak Japanese.\u2019 And it occurred to him that music is another language. So, if a two-year-old can start picking up something as complex as Japanese, and then an American can speak English, which is also complex, there&#8217;s got to be something to the environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right then, the Suzuki Method of talent education was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, he basically looked at music as another language,\u201d Novak added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, we start with sound from the very beginning, from birth if possible, that you&#8217;re playing good music, and that is defined as classical music in our sphere. And then, so they hear it, they imitate, then they learn to speak the language \u2013 meaning they learn to play the instrument or sing. And then, last would be the reading and writing. Same as we do with our language.<br><br>\u201cAnd his point was that if you immerse the child in a musical environment and it&#8217;s a nurturing environment, every child can learn.<br><br>\u201cWhen I was growing up, you either had talent or you didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the way music teachers looked at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd, with his ideas, every child has talent. It&#8217;s just whether it&#8217;s developed or not.&#8221;<br><br>The method requires parents to provide a nurturing environment, after going through their own educational process. Parents travel to the campus with their children once a month to work with institute teachers. They also get full immersion for two weeks during the summer. Instruction by \u201chome teachers\u201d is ongoing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe really value the in-person experience when you are dealing with a young child,\u201d Novak stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Novak sees a mix of families coming through the program, welcoming youth \u201cbirth to 18.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe do offer some scholarships, so we try to not make it too exclusive,\u201d Novak said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have an early childhood education, where we have infants also in the class where they are learning sound, clap, bounces, sings. Again, it\u2019s from as early as possible. They are just connecting with music, obviously not dealing with any instrument.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program features 35-50 instructors from all over the world, and current students come from 30 different states and three countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was the first institute outside of Japan, so we have a long history,\u201d Novak said of the 51-year-old program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"UWSP Suzuki Program\" class=\"wp-image-117388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Cellists practice outdoors, during the two-week immersion camp held in late July. <strong>Kris Leonhardt photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 A UWSP program is working to teach youth a new language \u2013 the language of music \u2013 while developing talent in every child at a young age. \u201cThe method started in Japan, post World War II.

Since moving to Wisconsin 1999, she has had help. Nearly 500 students in her molecular biology courses at UW-Stevens Point have collected ticks each year from 2000-20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tick surveillance is useful for predicting human disease risk. What\u2019s especially significant about Caporale\u2019s research is its duration. This is the first continuous surveillance of tick-borne pathogens for two decades in the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been quite an enormous, exciting project,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caporale first began collecting ticks in the northeast, where she grew up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she was asked to develop a molecular biology course at UW-Stevens Point, it was an opportunity to broaden her research into tick-borne diseases. During the first week of October each year since 2000, her molecular biology students collect blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). It gives students the opportunity to use DNA as a tool to forecast the incidence of disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blacklegged (or deer) ticks carry three pathogens that can cause human disease. Caporale\u2019s students analyzed all three: Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease; Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a bacterium that causes Anaplasmosis; and Babesia microti, a protozoan that causes Babesiosis. The latter presents with malaria-like symptoms, while the others have flu-like symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caporale and her students conducted research in what is known as a microgeographic region that is also convenient to campus: the Schmeeckle Reserve trail around Lake Joanis. They use white flannel flags to collect the ticks \u2013 a total of 2,008 in 21 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The students extracted DNA and analyzed it for the presence of three pathogens that cause human diseases, then sequenced the DNA to learn what percentage of ticks were infected with one, two or all three pathogens, said McKenzi Fernholz, West Salem, who took molecular biology in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They found each pathogen became more prevalent over time. In 2000, Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, was found in just the northwest segment of the trail. Seven years later, it reached detectable levels around the perimeter of the lake. The number of ticks with Borrelia peaked in 2015, which was also a year when a high number of ticks were infected with more than one pathogen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anaplasma was first detected in 2004 in the southeast segment. It reached detectable levels all around the lake within four years. Babesia was first detected in 2007 in the southwest region. It took eight years to reach detectable levels around the lake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The highest number of infected ticks \u2013 56 percent &nbsp;&#8212; was recorded in 2014.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An increase in the number of infected ticks in one year was related to an increase in tick-borne illness, notably Lyme disease, the following year, said Cody Korth, a student researcher in her lab.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The students compared their data with human disease statistics from Portage County and state public health units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s increasing here, it\u2019s increasing elsewhere,\u201d said Caporale, who has also researched ticks in the Kettle Moraine area, Colfax and Whitewater. Overall, cases of Lyme disease oscillate, she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caporale\u2019s students also monitored rainfall each June, average winter temperature in December through February and snow depth for conditions that favor ticks. More eggs hatched when rainfall was higher the prior year, and more snow increased the chance of winter survival, Caporale said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tick numbers around Lake Joanis dropped significantly in 2017. That summer, strong winds downed numerous trees on the north end of the trail. When trees were removed, so was refuge for white-footed mice, the main reservoir for these pathogens. Also, invasive buckthorn \u2013 a preferred vegetation for ticks \u2013 was removed or treated with herbicide. In fall 2021, no ticks were found along the lake trail where extensive restoration occurred. Students did find ticks around the Schmeeckle Reserve Visitor Center carrying Borrelia and Anaplasma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As independent study researchers in Caporale\u2019s lab, Fernholz and Korth analyzed all the sequenced DNA data collected over the 21 years and determined trends in tick infection rates. The results will be submitted for publication this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Korth, a biochemistry major from Marshfield, enjoys doing research independently in the lab, which helped him develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills outside of the classroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cResearch is why I came to UW-Stevens Point. I was pleased with how easy it was to get involved,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bHelping students learn research techniques and be inspired to pursue research careers is a proud legacy for Caporale, who will retire in August.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette STEVENS POINT \u2013 Diane Caporale has collected thousands of ticks during her career as a biology professor and researcher.

He became the team\u2019s starting safety and broke the franchise record for tackles in 2000 with 224.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the attacks on the World Trade Centers, Tillman put his NFL career on hold to join the U.S. Army.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day after Sept. 11, 2001, Tillman told journalists \u201cAt times like this you stop and think about just how good we have it, what kind of system we live in, and the freedoms we are allowed. A lot of my family has gone and fought in wars and I really haven\u2019t done a (expletive) thing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe knew, from the&nbsp;outset of&nbsp;the Pat Tillman Foundation that we would work&nbsp;to &#8216;carry forward Pat&#8217;s legacy&#8217;&#8230;but what did that mean? Over time, with (Tillman\u2019s wife)&nbsp;Marie&#8217;s leadership, we recognized the need for positive change and that Pat strove to make a strong difference through service,&nbsp;scholarship, humble leadership, and impact. The Tillman&nbsp;Scholars Program reflects these values,\u201d said Alex Garwood, a founding&nbsp;board member, the first executive director for the foundation, and Pat\u2019s friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs we state in our Impact Report: \u2018Our foundation\u2019s commitment is to work alongside our Tillman Scholars to fulfill Pat\u2019s legacy of inspiring people to become better leaders, developing ideas and solutions that result in positive change.We don\u2019t exist to reward service members and military spouses with scholarship money; we exist to grow a generation of leaders who embrace intellectual curiosity, act selflessly, and lead through action to transform their communities and the world.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur program, and more importantly, the Tillman Scholars like Natasha, demonstrate these characteristics and live them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLeon was born and raised in Stevens Point and left at age 18, in 2012, to serve in the Marine Corps. She served until 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cI achieved the rank of sergeant during my time. I deployed for 11 months to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. My job was to deploy and redeploy Marines to and back from overseas locations. My husband has been in the active duty Marine Corps for 18.5 years. He is a gunnery sergeant, and we were stationed in Bogota, Colombia, until last week. We now live in San Diego, CA. My husband will retire when I am 15 months into law school,\u201d she explained<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am extremely honored to receive this award, and feel thankful beyond measure. My husband is still active duty in the Marine Corps and so being awarded the Tillman scholarship means that I get to focus on school while not having to stress about covering my tuition and child care costs for our two daughters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAside from the obvious financial benefit, I feel extremely grateful to become part of the Tillman community.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;m amazed each year just how incredible these men and women are&#8230;I&#8217;m constantly&nbsp;baffled, blown away and shocked that there are folks of this&nbsp;caliber&nbsp;around.

In all these areas, working effectively with Native communities requires familiarity with specific legal, historical, and cultural issues,\u201d said Rob Harper, program coordinator and professor of history. \u201cWe want students to understand the constitutional relationships between tribal, state and federal governments, as well as the legacies of boarding schools and other U.S. policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbove all, we want to help students learn how they can apply that knowledge in their chosen professions. Forestry majors will see how tribal resource managers balance timber harvesting with traditional practices like maple sugar and wild rice production. Education majors will learn how tribal schools build curriculum around language revitalization efforts. Nursing majors will gain an appreciation of how Indigenous medicinal knowledge and practices affect health care delivery in Native communities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students will complete nine credits of coursework, from at least two disciplines, related to Indigenous studies. They will then apply that knowledge via an internship, practicum or independent project working with Native people and organizations. Each student will consult with the program coordinator to select the learning opportunities best suited to their undergraduate major and their individual interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more, contact the School of Humanities and Global Studies at 715-346-2334 or www.uwsp.edu\/history, or email Rob Harper at rharper@uwsp.edu.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette STEVENS POINT \u2013 The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Department of History and International Studies has created a new 12-credit program designed to enrich student understanding of sovereign Indigenous nations.&nbsp; Starting in the fall of 2022, undergraduate students will be able to supplement their major with a Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS) Certificate.

It is designed to recruit, support and prepare students interested in serving rural communities as highly qualified primary care providers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The physical therapy program was developed in partnership with local health care providers, said Kathryn Zalewski, P.T., doctor of physical therapy program director. \u201cIt has the specific intent of graduating physical therapists ready to collaborate and serve the evolving, diverse needs of rural communities.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program has intentionally connected to northcentral Wisconsin communities since planning began, she said. \u201cThe community asked for our program to focus on the development of primary care physical therapists with strengths in communication and problem solving. We are excited to deliver on this need.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The region has an older population with a greater incidence of heart, pain-related and cerebrovascular disease. Northcentral Wisconsin also has fewer licensed physical therapists per 100,000 residents compared to southern Wisconsin.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe DPT program model is sustainable, innovative and engaged with our local communities,\u201d Zalewski said. An advisory board of local and regional employers, educators and practitioners informs the program curricula.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program takes 2.5 years to complete, with classes year-round. It integrates community-engaged learning through a PT Student Clinic taught by professionals who donate their time.

Grown mostly for its fiber and cannabidiol (CBD) oil, hemp is used to make rope, fabrics, plastics, medicines, health products and construction materials.<\/p>\n<p>While growing hemp was banned in 1970 under the federal Controlled Substances Act, it has restarted in recent years through Wisconsin\u2019s industrial hemp bill. This allows licensed growers to produce and process hemp that has a concentration of less than .3 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive compound.<\/p>\n<p>Research at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point could help make this a bigger comeback. Ten students and four faculty advisers in biology, chemistry and natural resources are collaborating to show how hemp could once again be a major crop \u2013 one that not only generates revenue for Wisconsin farmers but has positive effects on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur research is focused on using hemp for phytoremediation &#8211; the removal of toxins from soil,\u201d said Brian Barringer, an associate professor of biology in the College of Letters and Science and co-adviser on the project. \u201cThe hemp plants take up the pollutants, allowing it to grow in soils that contain heavy metals such as lead or arsenic. This would diversify agriculture in Wisconsin and allow farmers to clean up the environment while making a profit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHemp has an insane amount of uses and could become a more traditional crop,\u201d said Sophia Risch, Kimberly, a senior biology and natural resource planning major who is the senior member of Barringer\u2019s lab and a researcher on the project. An acre of hemp can produce more textiles than four acres of forest, she said. It grows fast, making it a more sustainable and profitable resource.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGlobally, one-third of soil is polluted, and in Wisconsin there is an issue with soil degradation and lack of nutrients,\u201d said Risch. Hemp grows even in poor quality soil.<\/p>\n<p>Barringer has a license to grow the plants, which he is also using for another research project on wild hemp growing in Wisconsin. Co-adviser Bryant Scharenbroch, associate professor of soils and waste resources in the College of Natural Resources at UW-Stevens Point is collaborating on both projects.<\/p>\n<p>Last fall, students and faculty began growing seedlings of Colorado Cherry Wine, a variety of hemp commonly grown for CBD production, then transferred them into soils treated with different concentrations of lead, arsenic and fertilizer to discover how these conditions affected the plants.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStudents were involved in every aspect of the work, from the original conception of the experiment and overall study design to its execution and interpreting the results,\u201d said Barringer.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the last two semesters, students have been caring for and analyzing the plants as well as measuring the pH and electroconductivity of the soil, rates of photosynthesis and chlorophyll production. The student researchers helped quantify the production of both CBD and THC in the flower tissue, and to what extent the plants took up and sequestered the lead and arsenic in their tissues. They are also analyzing and interpreting all of the data and producing a poster that summarizes their research.<\/p>\n<p>Assistant Professor Shannon Riha, chemistry, assisted with a process called high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which separates compounds of the plant and identifies individual components such as CBD and THC. Assistant Professor Ann Impullitti, biology, helped with aspects of plant physiology. Both are co-advisers on the project.<\/p>\n<p>Risch enjoyed working on a project that brought students and professors from two colleges together, she said. \u201cWe need each other and our different perspectives. Our professors bring a wealth of knowledge to the project and having 10 students with different backgrounds helped the research go faster and more efficiently while expanding our learning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe results of our work will inform future directions for research focused on this economically important and environmentally friendly crop,\u201d said Barringer. \u201cThis pleases both sides of the political spectrum in the state and has bipartisan support.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The research will be presented at Research in the Rotunda on Wednesday, March 9. Held at the Capitol in Madison, the annual event highlights the work of students across the UW System and gives them the opportunity to share it with legislators.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also an opportunity to share the possibilities of expanding hemp agriculture in Wisconsin, Risch said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the critical aspects of research is to show people what you are doing and hopefully make positive changes,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times PORTAGE COUNTY &#8211; One hundred years ago, Wisconsin was second in the nation for growing hemp.

The new transfer agreement allows students who earn their two-year associate in applied science degree in Accounting from Mid-State to begin as juniors in the Accounting major in the UW-Stevens Point School of Business and Economics, with credit for the full 60 credits already earned. The agreement was signed this fall and is available to students now.<\/p>\n<p>The collaboration increases the number of transfer pathways from Mid-State to UW-Stevens Point\u2019s School of Business and Economics to three. The other two are Business Management and Digital Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer agreements between colleges help students experience an easier, more successful transition when transferring from one institution to another. These agreements guarantee admission, provide a program-to-program course map and allow students to maximize the credits that count toward degree requirements.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne way we collaborate with our four-year partners is through the creation of quality transfer agreements for students,\u201d said Mid-State Dean of Business &amp; Technology Missy Skurzewski-Servant. \u201cThere are many benefits, but what students appreciate most is the ability to start and stay local in their educational journey and experience significant cost savings on tuition and living expenses while they embark on their path to a four-year degree.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The transfer agreement will benefit students starting their academic careers, as well as returning adult students, noted Kevin Neuman, head, School of Business and Economics at UW-Stevens Point. \u201cThis agreement, along with flexible course offerings from the UW-Stevens Point Accounting program, will help working adults come back to finish their four-year Accounting degree and gain the skills needed to advance their careers.

I have been encouraged and heartened that so many of my fellow citizens and university colleagues have taken the time to personally express their gratitude for my willingness to lead an organization that has been so instrumental in my personal and professional life, and to the life of Wisconsin,\u201d Thompson said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the regents will soon identify a candidate to succeed former UW System President Ray Cross and me as Interim President, the onboarding process will require the full attention of System staff, chancellors, faculty, and the many remarkable people that carry out the business of the System every day. Until the end, I will work to accomplish all that is needed before allowing staff the ability to prepare for the transition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The UW Board of Regents is expected to name a new president in February.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By MMC staff CENTRAL WISCONSIN \u2013 UW System Interim President Tommy Thompson will resign this spring.

However, it is highly unlikely that benefits will be reduced for the 70+ million Americans already receiving social security payments, or those who are nearing their age of eligibility. In fact, we consider social security to be among the strongest of guaranteed retirement income sources, as it is backed by the taxing authority of the United States government.

The other two are Business Management and Digital Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer agreements between colleges help students experience an easier, more successful transition when transferring from one institution to another. These agreements guarantee admission, provide a program-to-program course map and allow students to maximize the credits that count toward degree requirements.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne way we collaborate with our four-year partners is through the creation of quality transfer agreements for students,\u201d said Mid-State Dean of Business &amp; Technology Missy Skurzewski-Servant. \u201cThere are many benefits, but what students appreciate most is the ability to start and stay local in their educational journey and experience significant cost savings on tuition and living expenses while they embark on their path to a four-year degree.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The transfer agreement will benefit students starting their academic careers, as well as returning adult students, noted Kevin Neuman, head, School of Business and Economics at UW-Stevens Point. \u201cThis agreement, along with flexible course offerings from the UW-Stevens Point Accounting program, will help working adults come back to finish their four-year Accounting degree and gain the skills needed to advance their careers. We welcome the opportunity to partner with Mid-State to serve this important population of students.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough this new transfer agreement, we can offer our students an efficient pathway to earning an accounting degree at UW-Stevens Point,\u201d said Mid-State Accounting Instructor Bob Smith. \u201cAs a graduate of the UW-Stevens Point Accounting program, I have experienced the benefits of such a degree firsthand. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with UW-Stevens Point on this and look forward to continuing collaboration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about Mid-State\u2019s Accounting program at mstc.edu\/programs.

Their accumulated retirement savings allowed them to retire early, taking advantage of withdrawals without penalties. During their working years, their combined income had disqualified them from making ROTH IRA contributions and their tax bracket disincentivized them from doing ROTH conversions. A concern we identified is the income tax bracket they will be in after age 72. With their combined social security and required minimum distributions, their adjusted gross income (AGI) level would force them to pay higher Medicare premiums than their peers who are in lower income tax brackets. Fortunately, they are young enough and retired from their higher income years so that we can take advantage of ROTH conversions, where we will methodically move money from their pre-tax IRAs to ROTH IRAs, paying tax due from the conversions at a lower tax rate than they had been subject to while working. The money in<\/p>\n<p>ROTH IRAs is not subject to RMDs, thereby lowering their taxable income at and after age 72, helping keep AGI lower which affects Medicare premiums.<\/p>\n<p>My clients are excited to watch their ROTH accounts build and their future RMDs decrease, as we take advantage of this sweet spot for retirement accounts.<\/p>\n<p>LouAnn Schulfer is co-owner of Schulfer &amp; Associates, LLC Wealth Management and can be reached at (715) 343-9600 or louann.schulfer@lpl.com. www.SchulferAndAssociates.com<br \/>\nSecurities and advisory services offered through LPL Financial, a Registered Investment Advisor.

Safe Kids Marathon County hopes that safety is at the top of their gift wish lists.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo many toy-related injuries can be prevented if parents know what to look out for,\u201d said Amanda Tabin, Safe Kids &amp; Injury Prevention Coordinator at Aspirus Wausau Hospital. \u201cWith the holiday shopping season in high gear, it\u2019s a great time to think about safety, as well as fun, by making sure toys are appropriate for a child\u2019s age and maturity level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To mark Safe Toys and Gifts Month, Safe Kids Marathon County recommends the following 4 toy safety tips:<\/p>\n<p>-Find the perfect toy for the right age. Consider your child\u2019s age and development when purchasing a toy or game. Read the instructions and warning labels to make sure it\u2019s just right for your child. Check to make sure there aren\u2019t any small parts or other potential choking hazards, before you settle on the perfect toy.<\/p>\n<p>-Don\u2019t forget a helmet for riding toys. Include a CPSC-certified helmet to keep them safe while they\u2019re having fun on a new bike, skateboard, scooter or any other riding equipment. Learn more about what type of helmet to use by activity at www.cdc.gov\/headsup\/helmets.<\/p>\n<p>-Store toys after play. Use a bin or container to store toys after playtime is over. Make sure there are no holes or hinges that could catch little fingers<\/p>\n<p>-Sign up to receive product recalls. Stay up to date on toy recalls. Safe Kids compiles product recalls specific to children and sends twice-monthly email alerts for recent recalls. Sign up for the latest recall information at https:\/\/safekids.salsalabs.org\/recalls-newsletter\/index.html.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, if doing your shopping online, be sure to shop from reputable online retailers and avoid unknown third-party sellers. The rapid growth of the of the online marketplace during the COVID-19 pandemic has broadened the avenue for the sale of counterfeit (fake) products. These counterfeit products may fail to meet basic federal safety standards and use of such products may increase a child\u2019s risk of injury. Check out these tips from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce about how to avoid counterfeit products.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about toy safety, visit www.safekids.org or the Consumer Product Safety Commission website (www.cpsc.gov).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times WAUSA \u2013 Last year, over 149,000 children 14 years of age or younger were treated in emergency rooms across the country for toy-related injuries, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The $9M award for the proposed public-private initiative includes $4M for the construction of AMETA Center in Stevens Point, $1M for equipment in the new facility and $5M for student support and community partnerships, making it easier for people to<\/p>\n<p>enroll and attend.<br \/>\n\u201cOne of the things that our conversations with our businesses have consistently shown is that there are many non-economic\u2014non-traditionally-economic\u2014issues that they\u2019re facing, that their workers are facing, whether it\u2019s access to childcare or transportation or housing,\u201d said WEDC Secretary and CEO Hughes at the event. \u201cThat\u2019s what you all did to get this project, and it\u2019s incredibly exciting. You are laying together support services, programming and incredible infrastructure to make this happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Slated for development on I-39 in the Stevens Point Industrial Park, the AMETA Center is expected to serve thousands of people annually through traditional programming, professional upskilling, K\u201312 early college and career exploration activities, technology demonstrations and business meetings. The Center is designed to supply Wisconsin with highly skilled workers, address the workforce shortage and sustain and grow area businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a wonderful announcement for not only our college but for the Central Wisconsin region,\u201d Mondeik said. \u201cThis grant is very focused\u2014we know what we need to do and we know how to do it\u2014all of these actions and strategies were developed from the needs that were heard from our constituents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>New programs planned to be offered in the Center include Advanced Manufacturing Technology, Fabrication Technician, Liberal Arts Transfer \u2013 Engineering, Mechanical Design, Supply Chain<\/p>\n<p>Management\/Logistics and Welding Certificate as well as the new Metrology apprenticeship. Mid-State programs that are anticipated to either expand or relocate to the site include Civil Engineering Technology-Highway Technician, Machine Tool Technician, Manufacturing Operations Management, Welding and the following apprenticeships: Electrical &amp; Instrumentation Technician, Electrician, Ironworker, Machinist and Metering Technician.<\/p>\n<p>Although the grant award has swiftly accelerated Mid-State\u2019s progress toward its original $9M fundraising goal for the construction of the AMETA Center, the campaign will now focus on securing the remaining funds needed to address rising construction costs and additional equipment needed to bring the project to fruition, with an anticipated groundbreaking in fall 2022 and opening in fall 2023.

Gov. Tony Evers visited the Stevens Point Campus Dec. 14 to publicly announce Mid-State\u2019s award of $9M under the State\u2019s Workforce Innovation Grant and congratulate the College and its partners.<\/p>\n<p>Mid-State\u2019s proposal was one of 12 to be selected out of 120 grant applications submitted by State organizations for the governor\u2019s Workforce Innovation Award, which awarded $59.5M in grants through the first round of the program. The governor also selected the College as one of five grant recipients to be awarded in person and highlighted with a press conference. He was joined by Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) Secretary and CEO Missy Hughes and Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary-designee Amy Pechacek at the event.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is great news for Mid-State, which is such an essential part of this region and the entire state of Wisconsin,\u201d Evers said. \u201cThis proposal brings exactly the sort of collaboration and innovation we were looking for in this grant\u2026 It\u2019s been amazing to hear about what great work folks are doing across our state to address the issues employers, workers and communities alike are facing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mid-State\u2019s Workforce Innovation Grant application, submitted in collaboration with Centergy and other community organizations, requested funds to build a regional collaboration around workforce challenges in central Wisconsin, targeting 2,500 unemployed, underemployed, underserved communities and youth with skills training and barrier-removing support services. The $9M award for the proposed public-private initiative includes $4M for the construction of AMETA Center in Stevens Point, $1M for equipment in the new facility and $5M for student support and community partnerships, making it easier for people to enroll and attend.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things that our conversations with our businesses have consistently shown is that there are many non-economic\u2014non-traditionally-economic\u2014issues that they\u2019re facing, that their workers are facing, whether it\u2019s access to childcare or transportation or housing,\u201d said WEDC Secretary and CEO Hughes at the event. \u201cThat\u2019s what you all did to get this project, and it\u2019s incredibly exciting. You are laying together support services, programming and incredible infrastructure to make this happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Slated for development on I-39 in the Stevens Point Industrial Park, the AMETA Center is expected to serve thousands of people annually through traditional programming, professional upskilling, K\u201312 early college and career exploration activities, technology demonstrations and business meetings. The Center is designed to supply Wisconsin with highly skilled workers, address the workforce shortage and sustain and grow area businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a wonderful announcement for not only our college but for the Central Wisconsin region,\u201d Mondeik said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis grant is very focused\u2014we know what we need to do and we know how to do it\u2014all of these actions and strategies were developed from the needs that were heard from our constituents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>New programs planned to be offered in the Center include Advanced Manufacturing Technology, Fabrication Technician, Liberal Arts Transfer \u2013 Engineering, Mechanical Design, Supply Chain Management\/Logistics and Welding Certificate as well as the new Metrology apprenticeship. Mid-State programs that are anticipated to either expand or relocate to the site include Civil Engineering Technology-Highway Technician, Machine Tool Technician, Manufacturing Operations Management, Welding and the following apprenticeships: Electrical &amp; Instrumentation Technician, Electrician, Ironworker, Machinist and Metering Technician.<\/p>\n<p>Although the grant award has swiftly accelerated Mid-State\u2019s progress toward its original $9M fundraising goal for the construction of the AMETA Center, the campaign will now focus on securing the remaining funds needed to address rising construction costs and additional equipment needed to bring the project to fruition, with an anticipated groundbreaking in fall 2022 and opening in fall 2023.

In 2021 a new renewable energy program was piloted for the sixth-grade students utilizing equipment borrowed from UW-Stevens Point. With the success of the pilot, Boston School Forest will use Cellcom\u2019s Green Gift to purchase its own equipment to continue to facilitate the program.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis program allows students to take part in activities which demonstrate how solar panels work and form an understanding as to why solar energy can help to reduce negative environmental impacts on Earth.<\/p>\n<p>The more students know about and have positive experiences with renewable energies, the more likely they are going to seek out renewable energy resources and make energy decisions that are good for the planet in the future,\u201d said Karla Lockman, program leader at the Boston School Forest.<\/p>\n<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Portage County provides enrichment programming for youth in the community, including its Green Thumb gardening program. With its Cellcom Green Gift, raised beds will be constructed at the Berard and Plover Centers allowing for weekly gardening programming throughout the summer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Green Thumb program helps our youth gain personal knowledge of plants life cycle and gardening techniques. It also increases knowledge of where their food comes from and the benefits of growing their own food,\u201d said Kevin Quevillon, Executive Director at Boys &amp; Girls Club of Portage County. \u201cThis hands-on experience offers an environmental experience and skills the students can use their whole life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A total of 25 green organizations received a share of the $30,266 in Green Gifts from Cellcom this year. The Green Gifts program uses funds generated from Cellcom\u2019s cell phone recycling program to fund green nonprofit initiatives. Customers and community members can bring in their old or unwanted phones to be reused and recycled. Cellcom sends the phones to recyclers who in return send money to Cellcom for the materials that were saved from the phones. Cellcom\u2019s Green Gift program completes the green cycle that starts with consumers being environmentally conscious and donating their devices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver the last year there has been a boom in outdoor enthusiasm as the pandemic pushed people outdoors for recreation and wellbeing. Organizations throughout Wisconsin pave the way for people to connect with nature by preserving and enhancing natural areas, providing educational programming, and spearheading sustainability and research efforts,\u201d said Cindy Durand, director of Public Affairs at Cellcom. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to support the many nonprofits throughout our service area that are not only performing critical work for our environment but also inspiring the community to become environmental stewards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Visit Cellcom\u2019s website for the full list of award recipients. Cellcom is proud to support organizations of all sizes, whose work is impacting the community and building a greener tomorrow.

Told by a Ho-Chunk elder and other Indigenous leaders, the stories were developed into scripts by UW-Stevens Point elementary education students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was so impressed with the students,\u201d said Rylyn Donahue, an education major from Lake Geneva. \u201cThe play I wrote with my group was performed by 7th graders, and we called it \u2018A Sticky Situation.\u2019 It was inspired by a Ho-Chunk story about collecting sap for syrup. I loved how the kids really brought it to life and even used props.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The effort was a collaboration between Amber Garbe, of UW-Stevens Point, and Chamomile Nusz, founder of Tomorrow River Community Charter Schools. They successfully sought an Oscar W. Neale Fellowship last spring through the UWSP School of Education to fund construction of an amphitheater at the charter school for outdoor performances.<\/p>\n<p>This is the semester before UW-Stevens Point students complete their student teaching in elementary schools, so working with Tomorrow River Charter School students provided a real-world, diverse experience, said Garbe, assistant professor of education. She worked with Native leaders to share stories with her students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were able to read them and learn a little more about their cultures. It was wonderful,\u201d said Kaylee Bukolt, a senior from Antigo. \u201cWe worked in small groups with one story per group to begin developing these plays.\u201d Her group transformed the children\u2019s book \u201cLittle Feather.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The project included inviting local Native American artists and performers to increase understanding of Native culture and history. The event opened with Ojibwe dancers and a drummer sharing their art and culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hope to nurture culturally responsive teaching practices in all my students, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to do that than an experience like this year\u2019s Neale Project,\u201d Garbe said.<\/p>\n<p>Education major Morgan Vande Hey, Wrightstown, worked with 4th graders on a story called Two Wolves. \u201cI thought the performances were amazing! The students really got into character and seemed to be having a great time performing.\u201d She plans to share a similar experience with her future students to help them learn about Native American culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy personal teaching philosophy reflects multiculturalism, so I was very excited to know that we were going to be working with Wisconsin Native tribes,\u201d Bukolt said. \u201cI value that UWSP encourages multiculturalism in their curriculum and that we had this incredible opportunity to celebrate the Native cultures.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Neale fellowship helped the Tomorrow River Charter School make a stronger connection to environmental learning and deeper connection to Indigenous roots, Numz said. With annual performances by each grade, an amphitheater on the site has long been a goal. \u201cThe opportunity for collaboration and coordination with UW-Stevens Point educators was so fulfilling for both of us,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>As a Waldorf school, Tomorrow River Charter School blends cultural and environmental learning with performance arts. It is located at Central Wisconsin Environmental Station, a field station of the UW-Stevens Point, in Amherst Junction.<\/p>\n<p>The Oscar W. Neale Fellowship recognizes and supports outstanding collaboration between UW-Stevens Point faculty and educators in Central Wisconsin. Neale was director of Rural Education from 1917 to 1944 at then-Stevens Point Normal School. A residence hall on campus is named for him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette STEVENS POINT &#8211; Education majors at UW-Stevens Point had an opportunity to teach elementary students about Indigenous cultures through performance art, which recently debuted on a new outdoor stage.

Prior to his current position, Gerlach was Superintendent of the Monona Grove School District for five years, the Galesville-Ettrick-Trempealeau School District for six years, and the Port Edwards School District for three years. Mr. Gerlach was also a middle school and high school principal and holds an Educational Specialist (Ed.S.) degree from Edgewood College in Educational Leadership.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis did not come as a surprise to the School Board,\u201d noted Erler, sharing that Gerlach originally approached the board with this intent to retire at the end of the 2020 school year. \u201cWe are grateful he was willing to stay with us during this difficult period providing steady leadership for our community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The School Board then approved offering the position to Cory Hirsbrunner, Ed.D. to serve as superintendent beginning July 1, 2022. \u201cCory has been instrumental to the success of this District to continue to move forward despite the current challenges,\u201d said Gerlach. \u201cHer leadership brings a sense of energy and passion to data-driven instruction, innovative programming, growing community partnerships, technology tools for a digital educational reality, and 21st-century skills for students.\u201d Hirsbrunner has been with the District since 2017, first as the Director of Elementary Education, then Assistant Superintendent. \u201cI am deeply humbled to have the faith of the School Board to continue to move this District forward for kids and our community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hirsbrunner has previously held the roles of superintendent, director of instruction, principal, and classroom teacher. Her aspirations to pursue leadership in a large district have been very rewarding. Mrs. Hirsbrunner embraces the close-knit and hard-working school community as well as the positive district and community partnerships that foster, support, and encourage a focus on children.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-115442\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917-400x533.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917-450x600.jpg 450w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/FP-School-Board-2-210917.jpg 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><br \/>\nMrs. Hirsbrunner received her Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, her certification in school administration from UW-Madison, and her Doctoral degree from Edgewood College in Educational Leadership.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette STEVENS POINT\u00a0 &#8211;

Diesel &amp; Heavy Equipment Technician student Damyon Hains, Granton, learned of his win during the third inning of the Rafters\u2019 Aug. 12 home game against the Green Bay Booyah.<\/p>\n<p>Free Tuition Thursdays is Mid-State\u2019s summer promotion offered in conjunction with the Wisconsin Rapids Rafters baseball team, with scholarship funding made possible by the Mid-State Technical College Foundation. Since the contest was first offered in the summer of 2018, there have been many randomly selected winners of the $500 scholarship, which also includes complimentary Solarus Founders club all-inclusive tickets to a Rafters game and a chance at the $15,000 prize\u2014the average cost of two years of tuition at Mid-State. The catch? During the contestant\u2019s designated game, the Rafters pitcher must strike out the first three consecutive batters of the opposing team at bat during the third inning without any of the batters reaching base (three up, three down).<\/p>\n<p>A recent graduate of Marshfield Senior High School, Hains is the first to be an automatic winner of the free tuition grand prize. His award will offset any cost of his attendance at Mid-State while he pursues his associate degree. Any amount remaining will be disbursed according to the Mid-State Foundation scholarship process.<\/p>\n<p>Hains\u2019 mother submitted his name for Free Tuition Thursdays earlier this summer without his knowledge. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know until four hours before the game that I was even entered, and I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting to win,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of foul balls in that crucial third inning \u201cmade it a little scary,\u201d he said, especially given the financial situation he and his mother were facing as he prepared to start this fall in Mid-State\u2019s Diesel &amp; Heavy Equipment Technician program.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt means so much to me to win this scholarship,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the money my mom and I have been trying to save up\u2014it takes a lot of weight off our shoulders. This will allow me to go to school stress free and not have to worry about making the payments. I can just come here and enjoy myself learning in my diesel classes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hains\u2019 interest in diesel technology started in childhood and took off in his sophomore year at Marshfield Senior High School, when he completed a year-and-a-half youth apprenticeship with Roehl Transport in Marshfield. He has since gone on to work as a diesel technician for Hill Road, LLC, in Chili, a custom shop specializing in heavy equipment and 4&#215;4 builds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love working on trucks and making them faster,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hains now plans to complete the diesel associate degree at Mid-State and see where his work for Hill Road takes him. He is also working on attaining his commercial driver\u2019s license so he can drive truck and run heavy equipment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joy and a privilege to be able to bring creative, fun, engaging ways for students to receive funding for their education,\u201d said Foundation &amp; Alumni Director Jill Steckbauer. \u201cFree Tuition Thursdays and this $15,000 prize allow us to be a game-changer for students on their path to achieving an in-demand degree from Mid-State.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times WISCONSIN RAPIDS \u2013 Mid-State Technical College has announced the first-ever winner of the $15,000 grand prize in its Free Tuition Thursdays contest.

A supervisory wildlife research biologist and project leader, he has served the USDA-WS-National Wildlife Research Center for more than 20 years. He has supervised hundreds of research scientists and technicians across the country, has been an affiliate faculty member of 14 universities and served on five Ph.D. and 23 master\u2019s degree committees. He also has supervised three post-docs and three APHIS Fellows. In 2016, USDA-WS recognized VerCauteren with the Supervisor of the Year Award. He is active in six professional organizations and is a national leader in the fields of wildlife damage management and wildlife diseases.<\/p>\n<p>John Kotar, Eau Claire, was named the CNR Conservation Leader (individual). Kotar, an emeritus professor of the Department of Forest Ecology and Management at UW-Madison, owns Terra Silva Forest Ecology and Management in Eau Claire. He has spent much of his career specializing in the classification of forest vegetation into habitat types based on relationships between soils, the environment, and groupings of understory plant species. This classification system allows natural resource professionals to make management decisions without resorting to complex, long-term studies. As his process of \u201chabitat typing\u201d is a staple of CNR\u2019s Summer Field Experience, he has equipped countless CNR students through the years with this ecologically based tool used in sustainable management.<\/p>\n<p>Don Roppolo, of Kenosha, received the CNR Outstanding Contributor Award. As the national manager of arboricultural training for Davey Tree Expert Company and a UW-Stevens Point alumnus, Roppolo has been giving back to the college on an annual basis for nearly 20 years. He has assisted the CNR in teaching introductory tree care techniques, advanced rigging and science of tree felling courses, as well as served as a committee member on the college\u2019s Forestry Advisory Committee and was integral in an initial red-shoulder hawk capture.<\/p>\n<p>Jerry Lineberger, Plover, former associate director of the UW-Stevens Point University Centers and longtime volunteer at Schmeeckle Reserve, received the CNR Field Station Award. Lineberger helped create the Friends of Schmeeckle Reserve and serves as a charter board member and its second president. He continues to volunteer countless hours to expand the organization, coordinate programs and events, raise funds for special projects and serves as an advocate for the reserve in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Wisconsin\u2019s Green Fire (WGF), based in Rhinelander, is the 2021 Conservation Leader Award (organization). WGF brings sound science and professional experience to natural resource issues locally and nationwide. Founded in 2017, it is an independent, nonpartisan organization with a membership list of working and retired natural resource professionals and experts in air quality, climate change, environmental regulations, environmental education, fisheries, public lands and forestry, public trusts and wetlands and wildlife. WGF has a core group of student members and those that serve on several statewide conservation advisory boards and work with the U.S. Climate Alliance and the Wisconsin Institute for Climate Change Impacts.

Students will take core science courses and select a minor in one of those disciplines and a certificate in an additional field of science. The collaboration is among the School of Education, Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy, Geography and Geology and the College of Natural Resources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis program better prepares students to effectively teach to the interdisciplinary nature of science,\u201d said Krista Slemmons, associate professor of biology and coordinator of the new program. \u201cOf critical importance, it also addresses the need for qualified science teachers in school districts across the state.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The most recent Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) report on school staffing cited chronic staffing shortages across many disciplines, including science.
