his website states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spectrum Review adds, \u201cAn album like Omega is immeasurably affecting in our current era, taking on the social issues revolving around race and racism in this country today, showing not only the horrors inflicted on countless individuals over the years but also the stolid strength of character exhibited by a people who have been put down time and time again. It\u2019s a lofty goal for a debut outing as a leader, but Immanuel Wilkins is more than capable of delivering on the album\u2019s premise. Omega is truly a thing of beauty and a much-needed bit of artistic reckoning in 2020.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central Wisconsin Jazz Critic Travis Rogers, who was always involved in jazz journalism, writing concert reviews, and album reviews, brings to light the beauty of Wilkins and how he adds a personal touch to his music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[Immanuel Wilkins] has a very personal approach. I was just listening to an interview with a guy named Keith Jarrett, and they were talking about music in the 60s and before and music today, and he said that he couldn\u2019t become a jazz musician now because it is kind of sterile. They focus on being flawless. Back in the day, when he was becoming a musician, it was about the person and personality, and that\u2019s the way that Wilkins is. Is that it is an old-school approach, and it is the person that comes through its excellence, yeah absolutely, the excellence is there. But there is something very personal about his approach,\u201d Rogers explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkins has a way of weaving various genres together, which makes him a big name in jazz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith Wilkins, there is a blending of straight-up jazz and other sounds like jazz and blues and even some gospel. That\u2019s become an incredibly important thing. It\u2019s not just straight-up jazz. Thanks to Miles Davis, the blending of jazz with even like rock n\u2019 roll rhythms and time signatures began to put a premium on those who could cross over between different genres of music, and Wilkins is absolutely brilliant at that. And to move in between those genres so flawlessly. If you were to look at a chart of the music, you could almost draw a line of going where the jazz begins and when the transition of blues and gospel takes place. All of that stuff getting woven in and out of the jazz structure is really, really important. Wilkins does that beautifully, crossing over between music like that,\u201d stated Rogers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkins\u2019s way of music transcends people into a world that is much more than just music notes, and it is a way to become part of the music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rogers adds,\u201dMore people should know [Immanuel Wilkins] as a household name.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilkins will perfom at Great Northern Distilling, 1740 Park Ave., Plover, on March 26.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Stephanie Faudoa Contributing Writer PLOVER \u2013 Great Northern Distilling will showcase the talent of Immanuel Wilkins on March 26.

It\u2019s a really big place. We\u2019re bringing a summer-level production inside, so it\u2019s going to be a really big show. Big light show, big stage, so it should be fun,\u201d Berndt adds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berndt is from Oshkosh and bass player Josh Escher is from Appleton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The others come from central Wisconsin; Todd Ashbeck, lead\/rhythm guitars and vocals, lives in Wisconsin Rapids, while drummer Jerry Anderson is from Marshfield and guitar player Craig Mitchell joins the group from Hancock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTodd, Jerry and Craig have been the three guys since the beginning,\u201d Berndt says. \u201cI joined a couple months later in that first year and Josh we added about two-and-a-half years ago. We\u2019re five guys from different cities and have different backgrounds, but we all have a love for 80s rock, and we\u2019ve all kind of had a hand in building this current lineup,\u201d Berndt adds. \u201cEverybody gets along, and everybody\u2019s having fun on stage, and we\u2019re really at our peak right now. It\u2019s been fun and we\u2019re gonna keep going.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rising Phoenix is coming into its own in what has become a somewhat crowded field of tribute bands, especially within the same genre of music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s really been a revival in 80s rock music, and I feel like it\u2019s never been stronger,\u201d says Berndt. \u201cAnd pop culture, with Stranger Things. That had a lot of 80s rock on it last season. It\u2019s really transcended generations and I don\u2019t see it slowing down any time soon.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rising Phoenix covers hit songs by bands such as Guns N\u2019 Roses, AC\/DC, Journey, Bon Jovi, Poison, Def Leppard, Van Halen, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Rush, Whitesnake, KISS and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery song we play is a hit song,\u201d Berndt says. \u201cAnd usually we play a little bit longer, too. A typical cover band show is three to four hours, where if you get the original band, they\u2019re gonna go 90 minutes to two hours tops. And it\u2019ll be a lot more money.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for learning all that music, Berndt says a lot hours are spent by band members practicing on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can practice while I\u2019m driving to the show. I just play the song in my car and I can sing along,\u201d Berndt says. \u201cThe other guys can\u2019t really do that. Once or twice a year we get together and rehearse some new stuff. But, we\u2019re playing so much that usually we don\u2019t have time to practice, so we just run it on our own and just expect the other guys to learn their parts, and then go through it once or twice (during sound check or before the show) and we got it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berndt says the band tries to take at least two weekends a month off during the peak outdoor festival season. But other than that, the guys stay busy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At last count, Rising Phoenix had booked 33 shows between Dec. 17, 2022 and Nov. 10 of this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where we have to turn down some of these places because we\u2019ve got so many people coming to us with so many awesome shows and we only have so many weekends to play, so it\u2019s exciting. We\u2019ve come a long way in ten years, from playing small town local bars to now expanding statewide and into the UP of Michigan.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rising Phoenix will visit central Wisconsin on a fairly regular basis this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will be at Rookies Sports Pub in Stevens Point on Friday, March 17, followed by a stop at Rachel\u2019s Roadside Bar &amp; Grill in Wittenberg on Saturday, April 8. The guys are back in the area Saturday, May 27, with a gig at Hoozels at the Lakes in Rome, followed by a show at Bullheads Bar &amp; Grill just north of Stevens Point on Sunday, May 28.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, June 17, the band will play Dorchester Days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will also be a part of the Fourth of July festivities in Pittsville, with a show on Monday, July 3 for the Pittsville Lion\u2019s Club and Legion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band stops at Tiki Beach at Lake Du Bay on Thursday, July 27 before heading to the Arrow Sports Club\u2019s Parking Lot Party in Weston on Friday, July 28.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019ll be back in Rome during Labor Day weekend, with another stop at Hoozels at the Lakes on Friday, Sept. 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following night they\u2019re at Mo\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill in Friendship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Mike Warren Contributing Editor CENTRAL WISCONSIN \u2013 A central Wisconsin 70s and 80s rock tribute band will mark its 10th anniversary.

Then we looked at where else in the county we could do something that would recognize or acknowledge the Native American presence and the deep past.

So, we kind of settled on Lake Emily, because the lake road goes right through here. It\u2019s easy to install something here; it\u2019s easy to see it from the road. It is right in the middle of a Native American site, but it also doesn\u2019t impinge on Native American burial mounds, which are protected under state statute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt also sends a message that the Native Americans are still here on the landscape and this was a really sacred place, just as it is for all of us who use it as a park.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"UWSP Emeritus Professor of Archaeology Ray Reser \" class=\"wp-image-117700\" width=\"471\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Installtion-4-221104.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" \/><figcaption>UWSP Emeritus Professor of Archaeology Ray Reser points out burial sites in Lake Emily County Park. <strong>Kris Leonhardt photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>\u201cKaren Ann worked hard and raised a bulk of the money; CREATE Portage County kicked in money for it.

And then the squash covers the ground with giant leaves and protects the ground from losing its moisture. So the Three Sisters is a part of our group all of the time.<br>\u201cAnd then on our three sisters, there&#8217;s no faces.

It sort of came out of the devastation of Japan,\u201d explained UWSP Director of Suzuki Programs Ann Marie Novak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDr. Suzuki \u2013 Shinichi Suzuki \u2013 was rehearsing with his quartet. And one day, he just stopped a rehearsal and he said, \u2018you know, all Japanese children speak Japanese.\u2019 And it occurred to him that music is another language. So, if a two-year-old can start picking up something as complex as Japanese, and then an American can speak English, which is also complex, there&#8217;s got to be something to the environment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right then, the Suzuki Method of talent education was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, he basically looked at music as another language,\u201d Novak added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, we start with sound from the very beginning, from birth if possible, that you&#8217;re playing good music, and that is defined as classical music in our sphere. And then, so they hear it, they imitate, then they learn to speak the language \u2013 meaning they learn to play the instrument or sing. And then, last would be the reading and writing. Same as we do with our language.<br><br>\u201cAnd his point was that if you immerse the child in a musical environment and it&#8217;s a nurturing environment, every child can learn.<br><br>\u201cWhen I was growing up, you either had talent or you didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the way music teachers looked at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd, with his ideas, every child has talent. It&#8217;s just whether it&#8217;s developed or not.&#8221;<br><br>The method requires parents to provide a nurturing environment, after going through their own educational process. Parents travel to the campus with their children once a month to work with institute teachers. They also get full immersion for two weeks during the summer. Instruction by \u201chome teachers\u201d is ongoing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe really value the in-person experience when you are dealing with a young child,\u201d Novak stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Novak sees a mix of families coming through the program, welcoming youth \u201cbirth to 18.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe do offer some scholarships, so we try to not make it too exclusive,\u201d Novak said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have an early childhood education, where we have infants also in the class where they are learning sound, clap, bounces, sings. Again, it\u2019s from as early as possible. They are just connecting with music, obviously not dealing with any instrument.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program features 35-50 instructors from all over the world, and current students come from 30 different states and three countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was the first institute outside of Japan, so we have a long history,\u201d Novak said of the 51-year-old program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"UWSP Suzuki Program\" class=\"wp-image-117388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Suzuki-2-220805.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Cellists practice outdoors, during the two-week immersion camp held in late July. <strong>Kris Leonhardt photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 A UWSP program is working to teach youth a new language \u2013 the language of music \u2013 while developing talent in every child at a young age. \u201cThe method started in Japan, post World War II.

And a lot of times, the applicants for the scholarship had said that the first time they&#8217;ve sat down with family members to hear the hidden stories\u2026,\u201d explained Trish Mrozek, planning committee member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWe&#8217;ve gotten thank yous back from the people that have been the recipients. And they say, \u2018this was the first time I ever got to sit down with grandpa to find out about my Polish heritage. I was really impressed with what they went through to get to this country, and then maintaining those traditions and those family characteristics that are important to them,\u2019\u201d added Leon Ostrowski, also on the planning committee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd it was really an awakening of their heritage and it&#8217;s sort of a renewal if you will. They say, \u2018Wow, I didn&#8217;t really look at life in that particular manner,\u2019 and kids don\u2019t normally think about that at that stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd some are some very unique stories. So, there\u2019ve been a lot of neat, neat stories that came together, where the kids just learned so much from their grandparents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd then I had some recently come back. They said as a result of the child being interested in filling out this application, I had to do some research as a grandma and grandpa to teach my kids because they&#8217;re asking me about it. And of course the parents are providing a lot of input to; so then they said, \u2018well, all of a sudden grandma found out some neat stories about their family.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had one case here where the girl&#8217;s grandfather always wore long sleeve shirts, and she could never understand why he just wore long sleeve shirts, even in the middle of summer. And come to find out when he was taken prisoner in Poland, he had a number put on his arm by the Germans. And, he was always trying to hide that because if he got discovered with that when he escaped from the German concentration camp, they would have killed him had they seen that number on him. So that was covered. And then, he was embarrassed about when he came into the United States. So, he totally maintained that coverage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis (other) girl was doing her research, and she found out and discovered that there was this doctor in Poland that studied the miners that worked in the coal mine in Poland and the miners that worked in the salt mines. And, the salt miners had very pure lungs and no problems at all; the coal miners had severe problems with silicosis and black lung disease. And, what they really discovered is the healing effect of the salt in the mines \u2013 how healing this was \u2013 and now it&#8217;s become a very big business where you buy these salt lamps and these sorts of things people have been their house. Well, that was where that came from, because it really is a health benefit.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cIt was interesting that she did the research in that particular aspect of history and so to speak \u2018discovered an old story,\u2019\u201d Mrozek added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants are required to write the 500-word essay about someone of Polish heritage who has inspired them or about their own Polish heritage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the immersion into the culture doesn\u2019t end with the application process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cAnd what has happened in the past is the recipients of the scholarship and their families attend. And then the recipients of this scholarship, we have a number of people that work with them to dress them in Polish authentic attire. And then they help in the kitchen; they end up helping to put on the event of the food being served. So, it&#8217;s not only that they are awarded the scholarships, but they are being asked to attend and serve. We immerse them back into the Dozynki Festival, so that they understand the meaning of the festival,\u201d Mrozek explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The students are also taught traditional dances during the festival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eighteen scholarships \u2013 three $1,500, five $1,000, and ten $500 \u2013 are awarded to high school juniors and seniors through the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe goal is to encourage them to go on for additional education after school,\u201d Ostrowski said. \u201cAnd, say some can\u2019t make it; they maybe want to take a break, do some traveling after high school, or if they go in the service, we\u2019ll hold that open for three years. So, they can claim that at a later date.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years over $150,000 has been awarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyward comes on board<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWe\u2019ve always had plenty of support to do this over the years. When it first started out, it must be a dozen years or more ago, we had just three scholarships.

Upon removing the windows, the owner of American Relics Dan<\/p>\n<p>Kearns advertised the windows for sale and they were sold to the owner of Mikey\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill, Mike Masgay within two days.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA friend of mine has an antique shop that sells my stuff and I allowed him to post [the windows] on the internet and we actually brought it back to Wausau and two days later it was back in Plover,\u201d commented Kearns.<\/p>\n<p>Masgay plans to incorporate the stained glass windows into the design of the new Mikey\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill location.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe thought It\u2019d be interesting to keep the windows right in the Stevens Point\/Plover area,\u201d expressed Masgay. \u201cWe plan on incorporating them into the design of the new location.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The construction of the new Mikey\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill location is underway and is progressing as planned.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe interior construction continues to evolve and get more complete. Every day the process takes another small step in the right direction. it\u2019s really starting to take shape and it takes a little less imagination each day to [envision] what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Masgay. \u201cThe project overall will probably evolve over a number of years but we\u2019re getting to the point where I would say in the next couple of months phase one of construction should be pretty well wrapped up and we\u2019ll be ready to focus a little more on the finishing touches.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Masgay, who is one of the developers who own the Artist &amp; Fare center along with the adjacent former Younkers building explained that the amount of business occupying the Artist &amp; Fare center is expected to dramatically increase over the next year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe currently have six or seven businesses over there but over the coming year that should increase dramatically.

Follow a regular fitness program before heading to the slopes. A basic layer of conditioning will strengthen muscles and build endurance that will help prevent injuries.<\/p>\n<p>-Check your equipment. A bindings check is always a smart move. Roughly half of all injuries are due to improper binding performance. While you\u2019re at it, make sure all your ski and boarding gear is in tip-top shape.<\/p>\n<p>-Know your limits. Ski or snowboard at your appropriate level. Beginners should avoid advanced runs.<\/p>\n<p>-Warm up. Before you hop from the car to the chairlift, don\u2019t forget to do a little stretching to loosen and warm up your cold muscles. Focus on calves, hamstrings, quadriceps and shoulders.<\/p>\n<p>-Hydrate. Don\u2019t forget to drink plenty of fluids as the day goes on. Dehydration can lead to fatigue.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEducation about skiing and snowboarding is important because it can help reduce personal injury,\u201d Callaghan said. \u201cTaking lessons or keeping up to speed on etiquette and rules of the slopes is very important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Aspirus Health, visit aspirus.org.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times WAUSAU &#8211; During a Wisconsin winter, you\u2019ll find an array of ways to explore the great outdoors.

History was made on that night in Stevens Point Rec. Department League Basketball.<\/p>\n<p>I was the official scorer for the games that evening at Madison School. (We played league games at the \u201cRec\u201d and schools like Madison, Jefferson, Bannach, SPASH, Washington, and Ben Franklin).<\/p>\n<p>My duties included working the scoreboard, keeping track of player points, team points, player fouls, and team fouls, substitutions, and telling players to stop whining.<\/p>\n<p>I also had to operate the game clock, when it worked. One night it stopped running at halftime, and we went by Kim Koback\u2019s watch during the entire second half.<\/p>\n<p>On the fateful night of February 28, 1990, all systems were \u201cGo\u201d as the first two teams were doing pre-game warmups. My buddy Randy Wievel, a fellow scorer, was on hand to observe the action.<\/p>\n<p>And minutes before the opening jump, things got interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Larry Kokkeler, a UWSP Communications professor, showed up to officiate. He was an excellent referee. A minute later, Gary Marquard, a veteran \u201czebra,\u201darrived. We were all set to start the action.<\/p>\n<p>But wait. In walked Jim Moe, chairman of the UWSP Communications Department. Jim had been a \u201cRec\u201d League ref for many years.<\/p>\n<p>So we had a slight problem. We usually had two referees, but never three. We had one too many.<\/p>\n<p>The refs huddled and decided one of them should\u2019ve been at Ben Franklin. So Marquard headed for the door.<\/p>\n<p>But not so fast. Wievel said: \u201cDon\u2019t let him go yet. We can make city history here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I asked him what he meant.<\/p>\n<p>Randy continued: \u201cDon\u2019t you see? There\u2019s never been a game in the rec leagues with three refs ever. Let all three do at least part of the game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So we did. Marquard stayed until the first timeout of the game was taken.<\/p>\n<p>And then came the real fun part.<\/p>\n<p>Gary Marquard, a ref for many years, was balding, and his nickname was \u201cCurly.\u201d He tossed the ball for the opening tip.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Kokkeler and Mr. Moe went to their positions on the court.<\/p>\n<p>And then we stopped the game. Everyone was confused. I said: \u201cFolks, this is historic. This is the first time in Rec history that we had three refs work the game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And better yet, just look at what we got. Jim Moe, Larry Kokkeler, and Gary Marquard. In other words, Moe, Larry, and Curly.<\/p>\n<p>The gym exploded with laughter.<\/p>\n<p>The chances of those three guys working the same game were one in a million. For the record, Lepak Builders clobbered Hohensee Financial Services, 78-42.<\/p>\n<p>Fred Hohensee, the player-coach of HFS, commented: \u201cThe refs didn\u2019t bother us. We simply played like a bunch of morons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Following the game, I sent a short report of the game and a copy of the official scorebook to Sports Illustrated. The national magazine published a few lines in the \u201cScorecard\u201d section of their March 26 issue.<\/p>\n<p>Archie Hansen later took some pictures of our three heroes in their ref uniforms. The UWSP \u201cPointer\u201d ran the photos and the story.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Graceffa, the Rec League director, was so impressed with the notoriety that he scheduled those three refs to officiate the American League\u2019s Championship Playoff Game on March 27. History was made again.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, former NBA ref Blane Reichelt, who stepped down after calling fouls on Charles Barkley and others for 25 years, worked many games in the Point Rec. Department.<\/p>\n<p>Jim Moe noted: \u201cWe really got a kick out of it. One of my buddies saw the piece in Sports Illustrated and called me from Maryland.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Larry Kokkeler added: \u201cI used to teach at UNLV, and our \u201cRunnin\u2019 Rebs\u201d just won the NCAA Tournament. It was a great time for me in basketball. I heard it was mentioned on Channel 9 in Wausau,and it got a big play on the local WSPT radio.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Wievel also had something to say. He smiled and said: \u201cIt\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t have a fourth ref around here named Shemp.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Tim \u201cShoe\u201d Sullivan February 28, 1990, is a date that should live in infamy.

Also going to people\u2019s homes doing seasonal porch pots and doing home consultations with design is something we hope to provide in the future,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to opening Detailed Designs Floral Boutique, Drevetzki was working a desk job that, to her, was unfulfilling, which is why she decided to leave that desk job and begin her pursuit as a business owner.<\/p>\n<p>According to Drevetzki, \u201cI decided to open DDFB because I wasn\u2019t being fulfilled at work (my desk job). I loved the people I worked with but I knew that my talents and potential were not being used. I have always wanted my own business and shop and I finally took the scary leap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Drevetzki pursued opening a flower shop because of her artistic background and her love for plants. Drevetzki shared that \u201cI have a design and art background with a love for flowers, plants, and decor. Using my artistic ability was huge in deciding the path for my business. I went to school for Art Therapy and having the human connection was very important to me as well. I still get to connect with people on the daily about funerals, weddings, birthday celebrations, and everyday life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since Detailed Designs Floral Boutique opened in January, it has been accepted within the local community and has received customers which Drevetzki is appreciative of.

Tickets will also be available at each venue starting one hour prior to each performance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one of the most beautifully written pieces of modern theater,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Connell, show director and assistant professor of arts management. Debuting on Broadway in 1977, \u201cThe Shadow Box\u201d won author Michael Cristofer the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play.<\/p>\n<p>The show tells the stories of three terminally ill patients who live in cottages near a hospital and are visited by family and friends. It treats facing mortality as another stage of life, O\u2019Connell said, as it was written in response to a new concept at the time \u2013 hospice, and the opportunity to die at home rather than a hospital.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt touches on so many emotions so effectively,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThe author\u2019s ability to capture both a sense of human comedy and tragedy makes it his seminal work. I\u2019m delighted to be working on it with such talented students.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He first directed the show 40 years ago, and always wanted to direct it again. \u201cOriginally I saw the play as being about dying with dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time I\u2019ve discovered it is not about dying at all but continuing to live until you die.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A cast of 15 will rotate between major and minor roles during the four performances to give more students a chance at meaningful roles. During the staged reading, there is no set. Actors read the play and each stands as they perform, with another actor reading the stage directions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no blocking, lights or set movement. Instead, concentration is on the words and their interpretation,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThe poetry of the language carries the show.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The staged reading also offers a more intimate experience for both the actors and the audience, O\u2019Connell said.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing the cast to Marshfield and Wausau allows more people to see the show in their own community without having to travel and gives student actors the experience of touring with a production.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City Times STEVENS POINT &#8211; A play that reframes dying as a part of life will be performed in staged readings at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point campuses in Marshfield, Stevens Point and Wausau.

Stations of the Flag is Helgeson&#8217;s Eagle Scout project. His plan includes stations around Lake Pacawa Park regarding the 13 folds of the American flag.

Each plaque will have additional information honoring Americans for their military service beginning with the Revolutionary War and ending with the Middle Eastern Wars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helgeson wants to teach people the 13 steps to folding Old Glory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He says, &#8220;The procedure for folding the American flag is not taught in schools, so children need to learn from family, scouts, clubs, and other organizations. If these groups don&#8217;t teach the American flag folding ceremony, then who will? At least when people come to the park they can walk around the lake and learn about it.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helgeson&#8217;s project is one step closer to achieving the rank of Eagle.

Then his planning can continue along with fundraising and donation collecting all while giving leadership to others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Achieving Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America program. Only 4 percent of scouts earn this rank after a lengthy review process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s all worth it,&#8221; said Helgeson, &#8220;Scouting is the best.

A 50\/50 raffle drawing is slated for 3:15 p.m., and concessions and souvenirs will be available all day.<\/p>\n<p>All members of the community are welcome to attend this truly unique event that brings people together for a worthwhile cause.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s Wisconsin Rapids plunge is sponsored by Ho-Chunk Gaming-Nekoosa, TCI Consulting, Plainfield Trucking, and Connexus Credit Union.<\/p>\n<p>More information, including registration and an updated schedule of events, can be found at PlungeWI.org.

Other events this winter include Oshkosh, Madison, Oconomowoc, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Eau Claire, and La Crosse.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s Polar Plunge features numerous ways to get involved. Individuals and their teams can return to plunge in-person. Those opting out of an in-person event can make their own adventure by \u201cChillin\u2019 at Home.\u201d Students can form teams via the \u201cCool Schools\u201d option, taking the plunge in-person or hanging out virtually. Less daring individuals can still fundraise by registering as \u201cToo Chicken to Plunge.\u201d Finally, the \u201cSupport a Plunger\u201d campaign allows fans to support other Polar Plunge participants\u2014all in the spirit of inclusion.<\/p>\n<p>Also new in 2022\u2014Special Olympics Wisconsin launched the Polar Plunge\u00ae referral program. Registered plungers who raise $75 and refer new participants are eligible for a $25 VISA gift card.<\/p>\n<p>All funds raised for this unique winter tradition go directly to Special Olympics Wisconsin, including helping nearly 9,000 statewide SOWI athletes train and compete at the state, national, and international level. The event also supports year-round health and wellness programs that enrich the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID).<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, nearly 100 athletes, coaches, and support staff will represent Team Wisconsin this June at the Special Olympics USA Games in Orlando, Fla. The Wisconsin delegation will #ShineAsOne as it goes for gold and brings home a lifetime of memories. Polar Plunge\u00ae participants make these memories possible!<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the Team Wisconsin delegation or the Special Olympics Wisconsin movement itself, visit SpecialOlympicsWisconsin.org.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette WISCONSIN RAPIDS &#8211; Special Olympics Wisconsin supporters from across central Wisconsin will be \u201cFreezin\u2019 for a Reason\u201d in Wisconsin Rapids on Feb. 4-5 for the 2022 Polar Plunge for Special Olympics Wisconsin, presented by Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics.

Okray donated a total of $1 million to two local organizations; these donations were to be used as a springboard for future growth. The first donation of $500,000 went to the Saint Michael\u2019s Foundation to provide funding for an educational endowment. The endowment would be used to fund research and training for new medical procedures and cutting-edge research in the medical field. The other donation of $500,000 went to the Stevens Point Area Catholic Schools (SPACS). SPACS would use the funding as part of a larger campaign to fund renovations and improvements at its facilities and to provide teachers a higher salary. 0<\/p>\n<p>The University of Wisconsin Stevens Point (UWSP) Men\u2019s Basketball team notched a record-breaking performance in its game against the University of Wisconsin River Falls (UWRF). UWSP player John Iserloth and the Pointers secured a 94-79 victory on the road in River Falls. The conference road win proved to be an impressive show on the team\u2019s record. Iserloth however, broke a record of his own with his stand out performance at River Falls. Iserloth\u2019s 40 points set a new single game scoring record for a men\u2019s basketball player at UWSP. He was able to reach the feat in large part due to his perfect 8-8 3-point shooting on the night.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10 Years Ago<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Amherst prepared to host the eight annual Winter Fest at the W. Jensen Community Center on January 28th. The Winter Fest, a Celtic folk, dance and music festival, featured multiple family friendly events and entertainment that were put together to give central Wisconsin families and residents an appreciation for Celtic culture. Of special interest at this edition of the festival, is that indie folk band Green Tea would be performing some of its new material. \u201cOne thing that people, especially longtime fans, will be excited about is that we will be performing some songs off of our upcoming album,\u201d said Green Tea guitarist Trevor Roark. The Eighth Annual Winter Fest took place on Saturday January 28th, 2012.<\/p>\n<p>As the city of Stevens Point prepared to take on potential new plans and ideas for the former site of the Center Point Mall, it still faced the hurdle of a lawsuit from the former owners of the mall- Valley Bank. The city had taken possession of the mall on the grounds that the building had blight problems and therefore the city could take possession of the mall and then could condemn the building. The lawsuit centered around the city\u2019s decision to condemn the building.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Lucas Jagodzinski 100 Years Ago A Soo line passenger train, departing from Fon Du Lac struck and killed an unidentified man from Waupaca County during its route.

The entertaining rendition of memories traverses the states of Wisconsin, Indiana, Louisiana, New York and Minnesota.<\/p>\n<p>At a young age, the author dreamed a dream.

After a late start, she achieved her dream, but not without a little luck and more than a little help from her friends.<\/p>\n<p>Through this book she hopes to inspire individuals to follow their aspirations, despite the price there is to pay; for there always is a price, no matter what choice a person makes.

Throughout my years on the team I have made so many lifelong friends and made great memories.\u201d Tricia states.<\/p>\n<p>Each year the Show Director and show committee come up with a theme for the one hour weekly shows the team puts on for the community and state performance. The theme for the 2022 season is based off of the popular Disney movie, Inside Out. Klein and her committee are excited to bring the script to life on the water this year. This year\u2019s theme is very family orientated and the team is hoping to gain new families to help with the performance.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on joining the team email aquaskierswr@gmail.com or check out the team\u2019s website www.aquaskeirs.org.<\/p>\n<p>Practice dates include: Jan. 23, Feb. 6, Feb. 20, Mar. 13, Mar. 27, April 3.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the Gazette WISONSIN RAPIDS &#8211; The Wisconsin Rapids Aqua Skiers Show Team is preparing to officially kick off their 2022 season on Jan. 23.

We\u2019re open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m to 9 p.m for food service and beverage service and entertainment after dinner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wiza and Ferkey plan to introduce more food and beverage options at Guu\u2019s on Main, focusing on approachability while doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Wiza explained that \u201cKellen brings many years of culinary expertise with a range from fine dining to casual fare. That being said, at the core of Guu\u2019s menu is approachability. I bring many years of high-end service and experience in craft cocktails and spirits. Expect to see your favorites with some new offerings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Apart from their plans to extend the menu, Wiza and Ferkey plan to continue live music in the summer, host fun and exciting new events, and collaborate with breweries and other local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Both Wiza and Ferkey have been in the restaurant business since teenagers and are highly experienced in the food industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both been in the restaurant business since we were eligible to work and have a passion for the food industry. Kellen started as a dishwasher for the Debot Center at UWSP in 1997 and I started as a busser at South Point Restaurant in 2005,\u201d Wiza said.<\/p>\n<p>Wiza added that \u201cwe met while working for At 1800 Restaurant in 2007, and worked there together for 7 years growing our passion for the food industry together. We married in 2014 and owning our own restaurant is something that\u2019s been a dream for both of us for a long time. With all of our combined experience we\u2019re excited to work together again, but at our own place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wiza and Ferkey ultimately decided to purchase Guu\u2019s on Main because \u201cpurchasing a restaurant seemed like the natural progression for people in the industry who start from the bottom and work their way up. We both have a passion for the restaurant business and the Stevens point community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Wiza has a background at Guu\u2019s on Main, which further inclined her along with her husband to purchase the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>Wiza commented that \u201cI previously worked at Guu\u2019s for several years and purchasing this business feels like we\u2019re coming home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wiza and Ferkey recognize that Guu\u2019s on Main is one of the most liked restaurants within downtown Stevens Point and they intend to maintain its reputation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGuu\u2019s is a staple in the downtown community.

Then it started misting, which changed to thin ice on the cold surfaces of the pavement and snow. By the time the trip began minutes later, the mist had changed to drizzle, icing up the windshield within a block to scrape the ice off.<\/p>\n<p>The trip continued with the defrost controls at maximum, and traffic moved cautiously, traveling at speeds below the limit and then maintaining speeds of 35 to 40 miles per hour (mph) on the highway as the drizzle changed to freezing rain.<\/p>\n<p>Approaching Amherst, an interchange offered a safe location to pull off the road and join a semi-tractor in scraping the ice from the headlights and windshield wipers, as well as the edges of the windshield so the wipers wouldn\u2019t try to jam more ice there. Soon another vehicle joined the group, followed by a fourth before the ice was removed to permit travel again.<\/p>\n<p>The road conditions began improving as county highway trucks applied salt to the pavement, and traffic began moving at 50 mph. By the time Highway 45 joined Highway 10, roads were clear and traffic began moving at normal speeds.<\/p>\n<p>Less than two weeks later, Jan. 5, another snowstorm hit overnight, with the weather forecast indicating that snow would stop shortly after noon, giving time for workers to clear the roads and treat them.<\/p>\n<p>Strong winds continued throughout the day and swirled the snow around as daylight hours changed to darkness. Falling temperatures precluded salting activities, and the gusting winds swirled the snow around, limiting visibility and making roads slippery.<\/p>\n<p>Those road conditions left highway traffic traveling safely at between 50 and 60 mph on east-west roads and 30 and 40 mph on north-south roads, as conditions continued southward beyond the predicted range of the storm, in fact all the way to the Milwaukee urban area. The weather situation was reflected in the minimal number of vehicles on the road.<\/p>\n<p>The normal 2-1\/2-hour trip took more than three hours to complete, about the same as decades ago before the four-lane and six-lane roads along the route were constructed. Surprisingly, during the entire trip, there were no vehicles in the ditch or signs of accidents along the route, indicating those who were traveling were cautious and driving safely.<\/p>\n<p>A trip to Minneapolis in slightly better conditions two decades ago led to a count of more than 75 vehicles in the ditches, most of them in the Minnesota area, where slippery stretches were reality.<\/p>\n<p>Driving in those snowy conditions isn\u2019t recommended, but people often feel the trip is extremely necessary, so they need to follow safety recommendations, primarily by driving slowly, at a speed that conditions warrant and to leave plenty of time to allow a break.<\/p>\n<p>A number of vehicles passed slower-moving vehicles on the previously described trips only to be passed by those they had passed earlier during a journey. Leading a convoy apparently made the trip a little too treacherous. The driver of one high-profile delivery truck used the emergency flashers of that truck to alert other drivers of his slow-moving vehicle which was traveling about 30 mph.<\/p>\n<p>The trips were definitely white-knuckled affairs, but were split between two drivers which reduced the stress and allowed for breaks.<\/p>\n<p>The second trip also provided a surprise to nerdy mileage aficionados. Newer vehicles automatically compute the miles per gallon of gas on trips, and the data showed the vehicle averaged 30.8 miles per gallon without the use of cruise control. Obviously, the white-knuckled driving didn\u2019t lead to toe-tapping the gas pedal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By GENE KEMMETER Winter is here, and that brings out something that is familiar with most Wisconsin residents \u2013 driving in adverse conditions of snow and ice.

A local club for like minded adults is aiming to help the community embrace some of that much needed positivity. The Stevens Point\/Plover branch of the International Optimist Club aims to provide hope and vision to the community as a whole and to encourage the development of these characteristics in the youth of the area.<\/p>\n<p>The International Optimist Club formed in Louisville, KY shortly after the end of the first world war in 1919. Upon the formation of the club, the members nominated William Henry Harrison (a descendant of the 9th US president) to be the club\u2019s first president. The Stevens Point chapter of this club formed in 1961 and has now been in operation for over 60 years. Known as the Stevens Point Noon Optimist Club, the club works to embody the philosophies of its parent club. They work around the community to spread hope and vision and optimism amongst all age groups.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the club\u2019s mission, the club runs many programs and fundraisers to spread its core values. For instance, the club chooses a few local students every month to honor the student\u2019s commitment and effort to be optimistic and hard working in school. The club rewards each student with a plaque during its meeting. In addition to monthly recognition of outstanding students, the local optimist club also awards scholarships to local students looking to attend a post-secondary school. In past years, the club has given out up to $3,000 in scholarship funds. In addition to these programs, the club has run a \u201cMagic Paper Box\u201d campaign to encourage residents to recycle non-confidential paper with the club. The club would then use that recycled material to earn money to donate to community causes that would support the youth.<\/p>\n<p>You can often see club members around town donating their time and money on behalf of the community. If you are encouraged by what you have read and would like to join or donate to the club, you can find the club online at https:\/\/www.optimist.org\/aboutoi.cfm. You can also find them on Facebook at Stevens Point\/Plover Area Optimist Clubs.

You know, a reader participation thing.<\/p>\n<p>I recently did a column on numbers. It got a lot of feedback on Facebook. Emily Woolridge correctly pointed out that my mentioning of \u201c100 Dalmatians\u201d was incorrect. It should\u2019ve been \u201c101 Dalmatians.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tom LaBoda said that I missed \u201cJenny 867-5309\u201d, a song by Tommy Tutone.<\/p>\n<p>John Lawlis brought up the fact that Yankee Hall of Famer Bill Dickey\u2019s jersey number was 8. And my dentist Timmy Cooper agreed with him.<\/p>\n<p>Bob Gollonik had several numbers to add to the list. Like \u201c21-gun salute\u201d&#8230;\u201d23 skidoo\u201d&#8230;\u201d20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\u201d&#8230;and \u201c300\u201d game in bowling. (By the way, Bob was one of the area\u2019s top bowlers back in the day).<\/p>\n<p>We should also have a complaint department. We had one where I worked years ago. A little old lady named Helen was in charge. She married a Mr. Waite. So when someone had a complaint, we\u2019d tell them to go to Helen Waite.<\/p>\n<p>Who named the streets in Stevens Point? Why is Prairie Street closer to the river than Water Street?<\/p>\n<p>One thing I enjoy doing every Friday at noon is going to the Final Score for heavy discussion. There\u2019s usually Jim Billings of Fort Dodge, Iowa, his son Jay, a fun guy named \u201cRings\u201d, Tom Quimby, Mike Donlan, and Ashley Balfanz. They all sit around and come up with trivia questions, usually about sports. The sessions are quite educational. This one came up the other day: Adam Vinatieri was an outstanding placekicker in the NFL for 24 seasons. Do you know that his third cousin is daredevil Evel Knievel? And Adam has some great family history. His great-great grandfather was Felix Vinatieri, General Custer\u2019s bandmaster. And on one fatal day, Custer told Felix to go back to the camp instead of proceeding with the regiment to the Little Big Horn. Crazy Horse and the Sioux wiped out Custer\u2019s entire regiment a few hours later.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another one that made the rounds at the Score: Name the six state capitals west of Los Angeles. Good luck getting that sixth one.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, that \u201cRings\u201d (Keith Ringberg) is hilarious.<\/p>\n<p>Another column I\u2019d like to see in the Gazette would be a Divorce page. You know, like quote the sad couple. Joe said Mary spends too much. Mary can\u2019t stand Joe\u2019s snoring. It would be the first thing I read every week.<\/p>\n<p>The Final Score \u201croundtable\u201d also asked if Stevens Point was the only city where a brewery was there before the city? The second building in \u201cPoint\u201d was a tavern. (The first was a lumber storage building). The Stevens Point Brewery is believed to be the fifth oldest brewery in the country. It was founded in 1857. Four years before the Civil War. Stevens Point was incorporated in 1858.<\/p>\n<p>The Pillsbury Doughboy\u2019s wife divorced him when he ran our of bread. She also had a bun in the oven.<\/p>\n<p>Took a walk downtown on the Square the other day. That lit-up Christmas tree is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>When everything is said and done, more is said than done.<\/p>\n<p>The other day, I was cleaning out a closet in the basement. And what did I find? A little kid\u2019s record player.<\/p>\n<p>From 1960. And it still works.<\/p>\n<p>A \u201c45\u201d was on it. \u201cThe Wanderer\u201d by Dion &amp; The Belmonts. My first record. Bought it from Graham-Lane downtown.<\/p>\n<p>So what was your first record? Everyone should remember.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Tim \u201cShoe\u201d\u00a0Sullivan I\u2019d like to see a \u201cLetters to the Editor\u201d column in the Gazette.
