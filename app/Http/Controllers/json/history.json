Cooper, had safely arrived in Hawaii. Earl J. Cooper was the pilot of a B-17 bomber that flew into the Hawaiian Islands at the same time that Japanese forces were attacking Pearl Harbor.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>By Gene Kemmeter<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Columnist<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earl Cooper of Stevens Point had safely landed his B-17 bomber at Hickham Field after arriving in Hawaii as the Japanese were attacking Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he taxied down the runway, looking for a place to park the plane off to the side of the runway, Japanese fighter planes continued to strafe the airport. Cooper brought the plane to a halt, and then he and his crew exited the aircraft to find a safe place for shelter as the attack continued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, the Japanese made a surprise air attack and ground invasion in the Philippines, and the U.S. decided against sending the B-17s brought from Hamilton Field at San Francisco, Calif., to that battle station.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The situation also found U.S. forces rethinking their operations in the Pacific Theater of the war, especially with Pearl Harbor having to deal with damages to the ships stationed there and the Philippines under attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack on Pearl Harbor stunned people in America, and Cooper\u2019s parents, Earl S. and Lena Cooper, told a Stevens Point Daily Journal reporter on Dec. 8 that their son had told them the week before he would soon be heading to Hawaii, but they had heard no word from him since then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days later, the Coopers received a telegram sent from Riverside, Calif., \u201cEarl safe in Honolulu. Stationed there indefinitely. Did not name field. Sends love to all. Will get in touch with you as soon as possible.\u201d He later confirmed he was safe in Honolulu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the B-17s among the 12 had been damaged during their arrival and were junked. Most landed at Hickham, two landed at Haleiwa Field, a small auxiliary field for smaller aircraft on Oahu; one landed at Bellows Field; and one landed on the Kahuka Golf Course. One crewman was killed, and seven others were injured. The remaining 10 B-17s would be repaired and stationed in Hawaii to help guard the islands in case the Japanese decided to resume the attack. The planes and their crews would be patrolling to watch for Japanese ships and submarines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search area was a vast expanse because Hawaii is so distant from other land groups and islands in the Pacific Ocean. San Francisco is about 2,400 miles away (a 12-hour trip). The B-17s making that trip had to carry reserve gas tanks to complete the journey, yet some still ran out of fuel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway Island is about a 7-1\/2-hour flight from Oahu, and Midway is another 1,185 miles away from Wake Island. The planes had to island hop between locations that had landing facilities to refuel and get a meal, but little else, before taking off again. The planned trip to the Philippines included Midway; Wake; Port Moresby, New Guinea; and Darwin, Australia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the distance, pilots and crews had to carefully monitor fuel and navigation so they knew precisely where they were. Maintenance of the equipment was also important, and many aircraft had to turn back on a flight because of problems. Going down in the ocean often meant death because search planes needed to find a crew in life rafts since the planes usually sank quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patrol area off Hawaii extended to about 600 miles, a distance sufficient for a plane to spot an enemy ship and alert authorities to its location. Plane crews were working long hours. \u201cWe worked night and day, not knowing what to expect next,\u201d Cooper said during a trip to Stevens Point in 1942. \u201cSome of the men flew as high as 18 hours a day and are still doing it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day after Christmas, Dec. 26, 1941, Cooper and the other eight men on his plane were on patrol to the northeast of Hawaii for more than10 hours when they started to head back to Hawaii because they were running short on fuel. Cooper realized they weren\u2019t going to make it to shore, so he decided to ditch at sea and await a rescue plane. Cooper said he performed a dead-stick landing, a maneuver that can be difficult when landing on the sea. He feathered the propellors (the dead-stick) of his plane, turning the blades into the wind, and told his crew to prepare for the crash. The plane landed on the water, allowing the crew to unload two rafts, some military Very flares and a couple of containers of three-week-old coffee. Between the crew members, they also had $600, but no place to spend it. The two rafts were each designed for two people, but all nine members got in, the four heaviest in one raft and the five lightest in the second. \u201cIt was crowded,\u201d Cooper said, \u201cbut not too uncomfortable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After they got out of the plane, the aircraft, with its 35,000 pounds empty-weight, sank, and the nine men were alone somewhere in the ocean. Cooper later recalled in a March 15, 1942 speech at P.J. Jacobs High School in Stevens Point that the next morning a plane passed over, \u201cbut the pilot didn\u2019t see us. We shot flares, but he didn\u2019t see them. We yelled nice things \u2013 he didn\u2019t hear them. So, we started to swear.\u201d The plane continued on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That first day the ocean was calm, Cooper said, but things changed that night when the waves increased in size. \u201cThe radioman and I became seasick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe blindfolded ourselves and, as long as we couldn\u2019t see, we were all right. But when the waves knocked us from the rafts, we couldn\u2019t see to get back to the boat. So, then we just closed our eyes, opening them when we were washed from the rafts.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second morning, another plane flew over, and the crew shot some more flares, but the pilot again apparently didn\u2019t notice them, Cooper said. Later, another plane came near, but again didn\u2019t notice the rafts in the water. That night, he said, sharks played around the life rafts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The waves were high again on the third morning, about 30 to 40 feet high, Cooper said, and the crew again saw a plane in the morning and then another one later in the day. About 3:30 that afternoon, he said, the group saw a flock of birds overhead and figured they were near land. The birds came near the rafts, Cooper said, and, all of a sudden, the radio operator (Pvt. D.C. McCord Jr. of St. Louis, Mo.) whipped out his .45-caliber pistol and shot one down. The bird landed in one of the rafts. \u201cWe ate the bird (raw),\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThere was a fish in the stomach of the bird (apparently an albatross). We ate that too. In the evening the men felt better.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The life rafts kept drifting, and on the fourth day, at 12:45 p.m., the crew spotted another plane. By that time, there was just one canteen full of water left. The crew fired more flares, and this time someone spotted the smoke from the flares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pilot decided to come down and take a look, so the plane circled low. The plane dropped a parcel of food that landed within 50 feet of Cooper\u2019s crew. Then the pilot flew away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Next: Finally, the rescue<\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Columnist Earl Cooper of Stevens Point had safely landed his B-17 bomber at Hickham Field after arriving in Hawaii as the Japanese were attacking Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.

New Hope in Portage County and the town of Iola in Waupaca County from June 26-28 triggered a backlash against the event that became known as the Iola Rock Fest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That backlash has lasted for decades, and mentioning the event today in the town of New Hope brings a less than welcoming response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most town residents don\u2019t want to talk about it, usually because they weren\u2019t around back then, and the event left a bad taste in the mouths of those that were.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event attracted an estimated 40, 000 to 50,000 people forthreedaysof music, but ended prematurely for many after shots rang out on Sunday morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the day, three persons had been treated at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Stevens Point for injuries from the violence and another 26 persons had been arrested, including 23 members of a Chicago-area motorcycle gang.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet the impact of the event remains today, not from the shootings, but from the litter the festival left behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fields were awash in litter when the event ended, and only community volunteers have tried to clean it up through the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The promoters of the festival purchased the property on a land contract, but then reneged on the deal after the event was over, returning the land to the original owner in its littered state for the price of the down payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe excesses of this event came as a shock to this rural community whose residents were conservative in their tastes, habits, and virtues,\u201d Ed Seefelt and Jim Stoltenberg wrote in their book Can Anything Good Come Out of New Hope?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wrote about hearing the beat of amplified rock music from miles away, a steady stream of cars moving through the quiet countryside, people from the site taking a \u201cskinny-dip\u201d in nearby lakes, and people stopping at nearby homes, asking to use the bathroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Portage County Sheriff Nick Check had summarized his impressions of the event in the June 29, 1970, Stevens Point Daily Journal, just after it ended as \u201cA nice big organized lawless drug party.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He revealed those thoughts as he sat on the steps of the North NewHope Lutheran Church in the town of New Hope at midnight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The church had been the command post for law enforcement officers during the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check seemed relaxed, but he was disappointed in the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone tries to hold another rock festival here, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep people out if it means blocking off half the county.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sheriff estimated it cost $20-25,000 to police the festival, an expense that would be borne by Portage County, the city of Stevens Point, Waupaca County, the city of Waupaca and other counties and cities that provided men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borne by them, that is, unless the bill was paid by the rockfest promoters, North Central Productions of Madison, headed by James Sitton and Earth Enterprises of Stevens Point, headed by Fritz von Buchholtz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill wasn\u2019t paid by the promoters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weekend had been a long one for local officials, and they had been compiling reports about incidents on the ground and in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources had provided a plane and a pilot to the Portage County Sheriff\u2019s Department for the weekend to monitor traffic control and the crowd.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lt. Ray Potocki, a detective with the county, rode with the pilot during the weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had been up in the air during the Sunday incident, and when the plane landed near the festival grounds, a young man ran up to the plane and told him that a group of motorcyclists had been shooting in the air at them, trying to hit the plane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potocki said recently that the man pointed to members of the gang to identify them, then left. Potocki said he and the pilot inspected the plane but couldn\u2019t find any damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man had left by the time the inspection was completed, he said, so they didn\u2019t pursue efforts to find the shooters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the&nbsp; final installment in next week\u2019s edition<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Columnist Continued from a previous installment: Click here The People\u2019s Fair rock festival in the town of New Hope in Portage County and the town of Iola in Waupaca County from June 26-28 triggered a backlash against the event that became known as the Iola Rock Fest.

far western end of the festival grounds to hear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the evening the problem was corrected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crowd was camped from the stage area back to woods, far from the stage at the western end of the festival grounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some were camped in the parking areas, a good distance from the action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanitation facilities seemed adequate for the

A Downers Grove, Ill., man, 19, and a Chicago man, 21, were hospitalized at St.Michael\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third victim, a Madison man, 26, was taken to the Madison Veterans Administration Hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cycle gang also attacked a rockfest patron, an Evanston, Ill., man, 20,with a chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also hospitalized at St. Michael\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One person was killed and three injured in motor vehicle accidents near the festival grounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Waukegan, Ill., man 25, suffered fatal head injuries Saturday afternoon on Highway 161 in Waupaca County near the rockfest site when his cycle ran into a cycle making a left turn in front of him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second cyclist was hospitalized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Davenport, Iowa, man, 18, suffered severe head injuries when he fell off the trunk of a car Sunday morning on County Trunk T in the town of New Hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was one of four young men riding outside the car, when he fell and his head struck the pavement.

But a six-foot, chain-link fence around the festival grounds was completed to keep out the bulk of people unwilling to pay the admission prices to the three-day festival of $10 in advance, $14 on Friday, $12 on Saturday and $10 on Sunday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who wanted to get a bird\u2019s eye view of the festival grounds, Wayne Parsons, a commercial pilot, offered air flights from the Stevens Point Municipal Airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ad in the June 27, 1970,Stevens Point Daily Journal (SPDJ) offered: \u201cSee: The Rock Festival from the Air. Thousands of tents. Tens of thousands of young people doing their thing. The whole bit from 1000 feet in the air. Bring your camera and binoculars.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tents for concessions and first aid were set up by Friday, and members of the crowd were erecting their own tents and spreading blankets in front of the partially-completed stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Riggs, a reporter for the SPDJ at the time, wrote in an article without his byline that Friday, \u201cTraffic of two varieties (cars and drugs)were predicted as potential hazards and early indications were those foresights may have been correct.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riggs wrote that one potential problem that was evident on the roads leading to the site was a shortage of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several persons on the side of the road leading to the site were looking for \u201csome spare coins,\u201d he wrote. Most of those lacked the money to buy a $14 ticket to gain entry to the festival grounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An editorial by Sherman Sword, Journal editor, in the June 26 SPDJ relayed the fears of older area residents about the event. \u201cThis is the weekend anxiously awaited by some, anticipated with curiosityby others, and dreaded by many more.It is the weekend of the three-day People\u2019s Fair, the rock festival over inthe towns of New Hope and Iola,\u201d the editorial said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMost of us have not seen a rock festival of any kind;we\u2019ve only read accounts of them whenthey were held elsewhere. The publicity has been far from favorable, andmany shudder at the thought of theiryoungsters caught up in that sort ofexperience. They pray for a three-dayweekend of drenching rain,\u201d the editorial said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Rogers, the city editor of the Journal at the time, toured the grounds on Friday and wrote a unbylined story that was printed in the Saturday edition of the Journal, identifying himself as \u201cthe reporter, a little old forthis sort of thing but curious, had come early Friday afternoon. before the rush.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued in his story, \u201cWandering through thegrounds, the reporter was surprised to see people advertising grass for sale; pointless, he thought, in view of the fact that grass was growing everywhere, free for the taking.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other observations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAmusingly, one young fellowwalking around had forgottenhis clothes.

of the site until 10 days before the event began.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fritz von Buchholtz, president of Earth Enterprises, and associate Ron Konkol told The Pointer, the student newspaper at the then-Wisconsin State University-Stevens Point, in its May 14, 1970, issue that Earth Enterprises was planning \u201cPeople\u2019s Fair,\u201d a musical festival for some 30,000 people with at least 10 well-known groups June 26, 27 and 28 in Portage County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers formulated the plans about two months earlier, von Buchholtz said, and there were 30 people locally and some 200 throughout the state working on the project, but no location had been chosen for the event yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Central Productions in Madison has been booking musical groups, von Buchholtz said, and \u201csuch top names\u201d as Paul Butterfield, Chuck Berry, Buddy Rich, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Steve Miller Band, Taj Mahal, Johnny Winter, Crow, Bowery Boys, Soup, and the Happy Year Band will play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The groups will play on a canopy-covered stage from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day, von Buchholtz said, and organizers plan to do their own policing of the festival so it remains peaceful, and also so there will be no one entering without tickets, while also providing adequate water and sanitary facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large parking lot will be available for the 30,000 rock, blues and folk fans expected at the People\u2019s Fair, he said, and tickets sold in advance will be $10 for the entire three days, while tickets sold at the door would be $14 for three days, $12 for two days and $10 for one day. \u201cThis festival is different than any before it,\u201d von Buchholtz said, \u201cbecause the profit motive is down to a minimum.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said advance tickets were available through a Stevens Point PO Box, a local music store and the defunct People Street Company in Stevens Point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said tickets would be sold in the University Center tunnel during the week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>News about the event then went quiet until a front-page article in the June 17, 1970, Stevens Point Daily Journal announced, \u201cRockfest To Be Held In Iola Area,\u201d adding that the People\u2019s Fair would be held west of Iola on the Portage-Waupaca County line June 26-28.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An attorney for North Central Productions of Madison, the talent agency for the event, said the 201.56-acre site had been secured, about five miles northwest of Iola, and is adjacent to where the Iola Winter Sports Club has its ski jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attorney said the rockfest activities would be held in the town of Iola, which was not zoned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The part of land, 55 acres, in the town of New Hope in Portage County was zoned agricultural, meaning regulations limited the use of the land for certain purposes, so the property would be used as an entrance off County Trunk MM to parking and the event site in the town of Iola.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attorney said the property had been sold recently, but declined to reveal the new owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Journal reported there were unconfirmed reports that people associated with the event had purchased the property, a report verified the following day when a land contract was filed in the Portage County Register of Deeds office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That contract said James R. Sitton of Recreational Land Associates purchased the property for $27,000, with $5,000 down and the balance to be paid over five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitton was also the president of North Central Productions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purchasers later stepped away from the contract so the property reverted to the previous owner, Ray Rustad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the attorney\u2019s announcement of the location, rumors had put the site in the towns of Sharon, Almond and Belmont, as well as other sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then-Portage County Sheriff Nick Check said the festival location appeared to be satisfactory from the standpoint of traffic control, but would require sheriff\u2019s department deputies to work longer hours during the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement of the location was greeted with \u201ccautious pessimism\u201d by Iola residents, the Daily Journal reported June 18, 1970.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local government officials took a dim view of the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The town chairman of New Hope said the town had troubles enough without the rockfest, while the town chairman of Iola said he was checking with the Waupaca County district attorney about town regulations that might restrict the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, June 22, 1970, the promoters finally released a schedule for the music, with the major groups on Friday being Taj Mahal, BuddyRich, Paul Butterfield, Siegel Schwal and folksinger Melanie until about 3 a.m. Saturday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday\u2019s music would begin at 11 a.m. and include Buffy Sainte-Marie and the Amboy Dukes; the final day on Sunday would feature Ravi Shankar, Chuck Berry, Terry Reid and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Credence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane would not appear, von Buchholtz said, nor would Bob Dylan make an appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had all been rumored to be on the schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monday was also the day contractors were putting up fencing, installing a stage and adding electricity and lighting to the concert site which was in a long, sloping field that formed a sort of amphitheater.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the property was mostly woods and pine plantation, with an old barn next to a lily pond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promoters raised the size of the expected crowd to 50,000 early in the week, and local authorities took additional steps to control the expected traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Law enforcement authorities set up roadblocks to funnel traffic to and from the site, on Highway 161, County Trunk T and County Trunk MM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roads to Sunset Lake County Park in New Hope, three miles from the concert site, were also closed to restrict traffic to the popular swimming beach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boy Scouts from the Stevens Point area at Camp Chickagami, now the site of the Central Wisconsin Environmental Station in the town of New Hope, continued their week of camping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, instead of the parents coming to the camp to pick up their children, the Scouts were transported by bus on Saturday to Park Ridge where parents could pick them up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stevens Point police reported they received a bomb threat from a female caller to the Stevens Point residence of von Buchholtz, the local promoter of the rockfest, and evacuated the building Thursday, but found no bomb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four taverns in the village of Iola announced they would be closed Sunday, the final day of the concert, and town of Iola officials said beer could not be legally sold on the concert property because no one requested a permit to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The town of New Hope is one of the few remaining \u201cdry municipalities\u201d in Wisconsin that prohibits the sale of beer or alcoholic beverages within its boundaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday night, the early visitors to the concert experienced a steady rain that dampened dry conditions in the area, and the crowd at the site was estimated at 6,000 by 11 a.m. Friday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheriff Check said authorities were counting the crowd at checkpoints and via airplane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fears of drug use on the site also surfaced, and sheriff\u2019s deputies said a Chicago youth, 17, was transported to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital Thursday and treated for \u201ca bad drug trip.\u201d First aid stations were also set up on the grounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Next week: The concert days<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Columnist Woodstock became the epitome of a rock festival when it opened on Friday, Aug. 15, 1969, and featured 32 musical acts until Monday, Aug. 18, on the grounds of a dairy farm in Bethel, in upstate New York.

He was also a younger brother of Mathias Mitchell and came through Stevens Point in the late 1840s on his way to the headwaters of the Wisconsin River and Lake Superior to search for minerals in Michigan and Minnesota. <strong>Submitted photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Thomas was born in 1787, and Hester was born about 1794, so Thomas would have been about 25 and Hester, 18, when Mathias was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas and Hester are linked to four children on the findagrave website, yet there are indications the family was larger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The listed children include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* Mary Ann Mitchell (1822-1904) who married Abram Stewart and is buried in Moscow, Idaho.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* Rachel Mitchell (1826-1909) who married James Milliken and is buried in Capron, Boone County, Ill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* Peter Mitchell (1828-1918) who married Laura E. Field and is buried in Buffalo, N.Y.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* Priscilla Mitchell (1830-1913) who married William Taylor in Boone County and is buried in Moscow, Idaho.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel says in a biographical sketch in the \u201c1909 Boone County Historical Biography\u201d that she came to Illinois with her two older brothers Samuel and Alexander in 1837 when she was 11 years old. Her father joined them that winter, the sketch says, and her mother came the following fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would mean Thomas and Hester had at least six children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel also said Samuel soon left for Sugar River in Wisconsin (now Albany in Green County), and Alexander farmed in the area until 1850 when he left for Pike\u2019s Peak, dying en route.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter was a pioneer explorer for iron ore and minerals in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and on the Mesabi range in northeastern Minnesota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A biography of Peter Mitchell presented to the St. Louis County (Minn.) Historical Society July 27, 1929, reported when he was 18, he went to live with his brother Samuel in Green County, Wis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1847, they headed to northern Wisconsin to the headwaters of the Wisconsin River, continuing to Lake Superior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuel (1816-1902) is recorded in the 1850 Census, age 33, a lumberman living in Wausau with his wife Jane and two sons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is buried in Albany, Green County, Wis., where he was one of the pioneer settlers, but his gravesite is not linked to the other four.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did Samuel and Peter stop to visit Mathias, who lived close to the river in Stevens Point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter settled in Ontonagon, Mich., using it as his base while he explored the copper regions of northern Michigan and Minnesota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there, he also served as sheriff and a state highway commissioner, in addition to his travels in Michigan and Minnesota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although his mother Hester came to Ontonagon and is buried there, he is buried beside his wife in Buffalo,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexander Mitchell is listed in five records on Ancestry as marrying Margaret Snowden on Aug. 7, 1842, in Boone County, Ill., but there were no other records found on Ancestry or other sites for Alexander.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three other possible children besides Mathias, who would be the oldest in the family with an 1812 birthdate: Isaac (1816- unknown); Samantha (1834-unknown) and Alvera (1840-1889).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac first appears in the 1850 Census, living in Boone County with his wife Esther and three children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1855 Illinois State Census, he is listed directly below Thomas G., with his wife and four children, living in Boone County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is last listed as living in Shasta County in California in the 1860 Census with his wife and four children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac apparently died in that decade, because his wife Esther is listed as keeping house with his son Marshall Mitchell, 22, a farmer, who is head of household in the 1870 Census.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samantha was born in 1834 and was living with Thomas and Hester in the 1850 Census. Samantha married Josiah Chandler Sept. 12, 1850, according to Boone County records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josiah and Samantha are listed in the 1856 Iowa State Census, living in Union in Story County in central Iowa, north of Des Moines, with their daughter Mary, 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the last record found on the Chandlers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alvera was married to Thomas Hopkin Emmons Oct. 9, 1859, in Neosho Falls, Kan., died April 1, 1925, and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Ontonagon, Mich.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is listed as born in Pennsylvania in the 1850 Census, Illinois in the 1870 Census and Kansas on her Michigan Death Certificate, which also lists her father as Robert Mitchell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No records could be found about Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1929 biographical sketch about Peter Mitchell delivered in St. Louis, Minn., says his father served on Gen. George Washington\u2019s staff in the Revolutionary War and was present when British Gen. John Andre was hanged Oct. 2, 1870, as a spy for negotiating with Benedict Arnold to turn over the fort at West Point, N.Y., to the British.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Thomas G. Mitchell was born Feb. 6, 1787, in Pennsylvania, after the war was over to Thomas Mitchell (1754-1824) and Sarah Hyatt (1757-1820). So, Thomas G. couldn\u2019t possibly have been present at the hanging. But maybe, his father was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A search for \u201cThomas Mitchell\u201d with a birthdate in the 1750s revealed the Mitchell Family Tree.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Daughters of the American Revolution and the Sons of the American Revolution have developed extensive family trees to verify membership eligibility in the organizations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Thomas G. Mitchell Family Tree states he married Hester Cowen and they had 13 children together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also had one daughter from another relationship.Mathias was the first child when he was born in Pennsylvania in 1813.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A daughter Sarah was born July 12, 1814, and died Aug. 25, 1875, but little is known about her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came Isaac, Samuel, Mary Ann, Alexander, Rachel, Peter, Priscilla, Samantha and Alvera. Two other boys are listed as children of Thomas G., George Spink Mitchell (1848-1886) and Oscar Mitchell, (1856-?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Spink Mitchell is listed as 2 years old in the 1850 Census, living with Thomas and Hester.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being largely unknown in Portage County and maybe to his younger siblings, Mathias Mitchell led an adventurous pioneer\u2019s life, like many in his family, and made a historic and lasting donation to the city of Stevens Point with the Mathias Mitchell Public Square that remains a landmark today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have questioned why the Public Square is an oasis of green space in the downtown, like the Public Squares in New England.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mathias may have been inspired to create the Public Square because of a plat for Belvidere, the county seat of Boone County, Illinois where he lived before moving to Stevens Point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Boone County\u201d in 1909 said the undated plat for Belvidere created a vacant spot in the central part of the town that was called the \u201cPublic Square,\u201d blocking Main Street as a through-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Streets on either side of the Square were called East and West streets, delineating the east and west sides of town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belvidere has since extended Main Street through its Public Square, while the Mathias Mitchell Public Square remains as designed in his Plat of 1851, a historic treasure for the community and a location for farmers to sell fresh produce.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Columnist Was Mathias Mitchell one of Thomas G. and Hester Mitchell\u2019s children?

Ela also owns his home and farm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ela, who was born in September 1840 in Illinois, died Jan. 17, 1904, in Santa Ana in Orange County, Calif. He is buried in Santa Ana Cemetery. His family included three sons, Clarence A Mitchell (1872-1922), Fred Forrest Mitchell (1875-1940) and Maurice Ela Mitchell (1884-1926) and one daughter, Irene M. Mitchell Kiefhaber (1879-1967).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His wife, who was born in 1851, died April 5, 1933, and is also buried in Santa Ana Cemetery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ela has been relatively easy to trace because of the internet and his return to Portage County in 1891, his two sisters, Hester, born in 1837, and Emeline, born in 1844, were difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Power of Attorney about Mathias\u2019 estate listing Emeline Bennett as an heir to that estate identified her through her married name, but what about Hester?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stevens Point Area Genealogical Society has provided a tremendous service to Portage County residents and others by compiling an index for the names of the brides in Portage County marriage records and posting that index, along with other reference assistance, for Portage County residents and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That indexis posted on the Genealogical Society website at https:\/\/www.spagswi.org\/index.html under \u201cResources\u201d and reports that Hester Ann Mitchell was married to William Henry Hewins on Dec. 25, 1856, in Portage County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1850 Census for Hester A. Mitchell living in Stevens Point with Mathias and Catherine Mitchell is also linked on Ancestry to a Hester A. Hewins who in the 1870 Census is living in Dover in Shawnee County, Kansas. That Hester is listed as 33 years old and born in Indiana and living with William H. Hewins, 38, born in Massachusetts; and sons Ira, 12 (1858), born in Wisconsin; and Edwin, 5 (1865), born in Kansas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1857, a William H. Hewins received a land grant for 120 acres in Marathon County through the Stevens Point Land Office. Did he meet Hester through that transaction or was he also living in Stevens Point? The marriage record provided the direct link of Hester Mitchell to Hester Hewins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were they perhaps enroute from Wisconsin to Kansas when the 1860 Census was taken, thus missing the count?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1870 Census was the first one mentioning William H. Hewins, and his family is listed in the 1875 Kansas State Census. They are still living in Dover, and William is 44, born in Massachusetts; Hester, 38, born in Indiana; Ira, 17, born in Wisconsin; Edwin H., 10, born in Kansas; and Hugh, 4, born in Kansas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are still living in Dover in the 1880 Census, all 5 years older than the Kansas Census, but their surname has been recorded as \u201cHecoms\u201d and Hester is listed as \u201cEster.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Find A Grave record has Hester Ann Hewins listed as born May 26, 1832, in Fountain County, Indiana, and died Dec. 18, 1886, in Dover. So Hester was dead when the Power of Attorney was sought, so she was no longer an heir. Her husband William is listed as born March 26, 1830, and died Feb. 18, 1897.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Mathias Mitchell came to Stevens Point in the 1840s, what about his siblings? Was he the son of Thomas G. and Hester Mitchell? Was his first-born daughter named after his mother, like many men did when they had children?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1840 Census was the first Census to identify a Mathias Mitchell. He was listed as a male between the ages of 20 and 30 living in Deerfield in Boone County, Illinois, a county just south of Rock County in Wisconsin. Boone County is also bordered on the west by Illinois\u2019 Winnebago County, which contains the city of Rockford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias was living with a female under the age of 5 and another female between the ages of 20 and 30, possibly referencing a husband with a wife and a young girl.Both Mathias and Catherine fit within the age ranges for the older ones, and Hester would have been about 3 years old, matching the female under 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias is also named on grants for land in Boone County, Illinois, between 1839 and 1841, similar to the land grants he was acquiring in Portage County.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directly above Mathias in the Census is a household listing for a Thomas G. Mitchell as head of household with two males, one between the ages of 20 and 30 and the other between the ages of 50 and 60. There are also six females in Thomas\u2019 household, one under the age of 5, two between 5 and 10, one between 15 and 20, one between 20 and 30 and one between 40 and 50.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was that Mathias Mitchell the donor of the Public Square, and was Thomas G. Mitchell, the 50-60-year-old, possibly his father and the 20-to 30-year olds, along with the younger oneshis siblings?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1850 Census for the town of Boone in Boone County, Illinois, lists a Thomas G. Mitchell, 65, a farmer with real estate valued at $1,400 living in a household with his wife Hester, 56; and two girls, Samantha Mitchell, 16, and Alvera (listed as \u201cElvira\u201d Mitchell, 10. Are the girls daughters, grandchildren or nieces? They aren\u2019t identified. Alvera appears to be too young to be a child of Hester\u2019s, whowould have been 46 when Alvera was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1870 Census lists Thomas and Hester Mitchell living in the town of Boone in Boone County, Illinois, the same area they were living in the 1840 and 1850 Censuses. Living with them are their daughter, Priscilla Taylor, 38; her husband, William Taylor, 45, and their seven children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1880 Census for Neosho Falls in Woodson County in southeastern Kansas, T.G. Mitchell and Hester are living with George P. Mitchell, 12, born in Illinois, and Oscar Mitchell, 5, born in Wisconsin. The boys aren\u2019t further identified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas G.

The power of attorney authorizes an attorney of the heirs to recover and collect all debts owed to the Mitchell estate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing also identified Emeline Bennett as the daughter of Mathias and Catherine and divorced wife of Alfred Bennett. That solved the mystery of what happened to the younger daughter of Mathias and Catherine who was born about 1844 based on the 1850 Census but wasn\u2019t living with the family when the 1860 Census was taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Emeline Mitchell was the wife of Alfred Bennett sets off another search: who was Alfred Bennett?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alfred Bennett was a Civil War soldier who enlisted in Company Bof the 14th Infantry Regiment in Plover on Oct. 28, 1861, and was discharged due to disability on Aug. 23, 1862. Like Mathias Mitchell\u2019s son Ela, the disability isn\u2019t disclosed in state Civil War records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14th had been engaged in the Battle of Shiloh in southwestern Tennessee on April 6 and 7, 1862, and then remained at the site as provost guard as other Union units moved toward Corinth, Miss., where the Confederates had fled after the battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chapter 22 of E.B. Quiner\u2019s Military History of Wisconsin in the Civil War, Quiner wrote \u201cfor four days they (the regiment) remained without tents, exposed to almost continual rains and without sufficient rations. The fatigues of the battle, and these exposures, together with the unhealthiness of the position, produced much sickness.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regiment remained at Shiloh until July 23, 1862, when the 14th was assigned to provost guard duty at Hamburg Landing, Tenn., where they were until Aug. 23, 1862. That day Bennett was mustered out of service, and the regiment was ordered to Corinth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alfred Bennett in Civil War records are linked on Ancestry to Alfred Bennett, then 13, in the 1850 Census, living in the town of Hubbard, Dodge County, Wis., with his parents, Jeremiah Bennett, 39, born in New York, and Emeline, 37, born in New Hampshire; his brothers Jonathon, 16, Thomas, 10, and Joseph, 5; and his sisters, Naomi, 9, and Susannah, 10 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1860 Census, Alfred, 23, is a farmer, living in town of Canton, Jefferson County, Missouri, with his wife, Emeline, 19, and his daughter, Kate, 9 months, born in Missouri. Alfred\u2019s parents, Jeremiah and \u201cEmmaline,\u201d are living in the town of Stockton in Portage County with their sons Joseph, 15, and James, 8; and their daughters, Susannah, 10, and \u201cWealthy,\u201d 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alfred is listed in the 1870 Census as Bernett Alferd, 34, a farmer living in the town of Murray in Alameda County, California. He is living with his wife, Emeline, 27; their daughter Kate, 10; and a son, B., 5, who was born in Wisconsin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are living next door to J. (Jeremiah) Bennett, 60; his wife Adeline, 58; their son James. 18; and daughter Annette, 15. Both children were born in Wisconsin, and Annette appears to match the \u201cWealthy\u201d listed in the 1860 Census.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alfred Bennett isn\u2019t listed again in the U.S. Census records until 1900 when he was 52, working as a saloon keeper and living in Township 1 of Placer County in California. Alfred died Jan. 20, 1910, and is buried in Roselawn Cemetery in Livermore, Alameda County, California. His birthdate is listed as Aug. 16, 1836.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emeline (Mitchell) Bennett, 37, is listed in the 1880 Census as living in the town of Murray in Alameda County, California, with her son Bert, 15; and her daughter Katie Shipman, 20, a widow, and Katie\u2019s children, Carrie Shipman, 3, and Charles Shipman, 1, both born in California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no records available for the U.S. Census in 1890 because a January 1921 fire damaged some of the records, while others were water damaged during the effort to put the fire out.Later, officials decided to burn the damaged and other records for that Census, doing so in 1934. In 1942 and again in 1953, the National Archives found fragments of some records and retain those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That results in a 20-year gap in Census records, which help track people across the nation. Some states have voter registration records, but women were unable to vote, so they aren\u2019t listed as registered voters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catharine Mitchell, Mathias\u2019 widow, was alive in 1891 when she applied for the Power of Attorney, but she isn\u2019t listed in the 1900 Census. She would have been 85 or 86 years old at that time (based on her ages recorded in prior Census records) when people living that long were uncommon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emeline \u201cEmma\u201d Bennett, 55, is listed in the 1900 Census as living in the township of Murray in Alameda County, California, in the household of Joshua Chadbourne, 67, with his wife Francis Chadbourne, 69; their granddaughter, Ethal Harris, 24, a dressmaker; Inang Yong, 34, a garden laborer; and Charles S. Haley, 30, their nephew and a stableman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Census says Emeline was born in July 1844 in Illinois of parents born in Pennsylvania, and she was a widow, even though her former husband was still alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In regard to Emeline\u2019s children, California marriage records show a K.E. Bennett married a C.J. Shipman on July 31, 1876, in Alameda, Calif. (The records only use initials, no first or middle names.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1880 Census recorded that Kate Bennett Shipman was a widow, but there\u2019s no record of her husband\u2019s death. A link on Ancestry from that Census record goes to Find A Grave.com goes to a Kate Bennett Sherman (1859-1897) gravestone in Lookout Cemetery in Modoc County, California.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Links on that Find A Grave page go to the Ancestry records for Kate in the 1860, 1870 and 1880 Censuses, plus the marriage record. There is also a link to a 1900 Census to a Kate Sherman who died in 1933. Another puzzle in the search to find ancestors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no links to other records for Kate\u2019s daughter Carrie, 3; but there is one for her son, Charles, who was 1 in 1880. That goes to the voter registration record of Charles Wallace Shipman, 31, a housemover living in Alameda, Calif., in 1908.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emeline\u2019s son, Burt William Bennett, had a long life. He died at the age of 89 on Feb. 2, 1954, in Alameda, Calif., and is buried in Alamo Cemetery in Contra Costa County,Calif. His death record shows he was born June 12, 1864, in Wisconsin. His Social Security Registration says he was born June 12, 1864, in Plover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burt married Florence Rosella Fairfield in 1887, and they had three girls, two of whom lived longer than he did. His wife, known as Rosella, died June 15, 1900, at age 39. She was born in 1861.Their three daughters were 12, 10 and 3 years old when she died.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He worked as a farmer and laborer in Contra Costa County, a machinist in shipyards in Oakland and chief of police in Pleasanton, Calif., before retiring, according to Census records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To be continued<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Columnist Continued from a previous edition The wife of Mathias Mitchell and one of his daughters received a Power of Attorney to act on his behalf to recover his estate in a filing at the Portage County Register of Deeds Office May 7, 1891.

Reading old handwritten records can be difficult because of penmanship. Submitted image<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By Gene Kemmeter<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Continued from previous week<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias Mitchell spent at least two decades in the Stevens Point area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He lived in the downtown area of Stevens Point on Main Street when the 1850 U.S. Census was taken Sept. 14, 1850, and moved to the town of Plover before the 1860 Census was taken July 27, 1860.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1850 Census said \u201cMatthias\u201d Mitchell was a 37-year-old resident of the town of Stevens Point (it didn\u2019t become a city until 1858) who was a lumberman owning real estate valued at $4,000 and was born in Pennsylvania.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was living with his wife, Catharine, 35, who was also born in Pennsylvania; a daughter, Hester, 13, who was born in Indiana; a son, \u201cEli,\u201d 9, who was born in Illinois; and a daughter, Emeline, 6, who was born in Illinois.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1860 Census said \u201cMatthias\u201d was a 48-year-old resident of the town of Plover (even though the Census was taken two months earlier than in 1850 when he was 37).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was still a lumberman engaged in lumbering and had real estate valued at $4,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with him are his wife, Catharine, 46, (she also gained a year in age), who was born in Pennsylvania; and his son \u201cEli,\u201d 19, who was born in Illinois.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing from the listing are his daughters, Hester, who was 13 in 1850; and Emeline, who was 6 then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have the two daughters gotten married, or died, or have they moved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no personal records in the Portage County Register of Deeds office on either of the daughters through their maiden names in the marriage or death records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The marriage records are only alphabetized with the male surnames, so all the records would have to be searched to find the female surname.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Death records usually list the female surname, but are also indexed by the spouse\u2019s name if married.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching for the Mitchell\u2019s son, Ela C. Mitchell (who had been listed on the Census records as \u201cEli\u201d) would prove to be more fruitful in the chronological order of this story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ancestry listed a record that identified Ela as a Civil War veteran. Wisconsin Civil War records show\u201cEly\u201d (instead of Ela) enlisted June 25, 1861, as a private in Company E, FifthWisconsin Infantry Regiment, in Plover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was discharged Nov. 11, 1861, with a disability. The type of disability isn\u2019t listed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the disability must have been of some serious nature, at least temporarily, because Mathias was appointed power of attorney Sept. 6, 1862, in an action filed with the Portage County Register of Deeds Office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power of attorney is a legal authorization for a designated person to make decisions about another person\u2019s property, finances, or medical care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the next Census was in 1870, and Ela was still alive in 1891 according to the Journal story, a search for Ela Mitchell found Ela, 29, born in Illinois, was living in the town of Bishop Creek in Inyo County, Calif., and working as a farmer, with real estate worth $250 and a personal estate of $900.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with him was his mother, Catherine Mitchell, 56, born in Pennsylvania, and she was keeping house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did that mean that Mathias had died between 1860 and 1870, or was he someplace else when the Census was taken?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A record of land transactions in the Portage County Register of Deed Office show that on April 13, 1866, Mathias and Catharine Mitchell of Union County, territory of Dekotah, in southwestern Iowa, granted a warranty deed to Emeline Bennett of Portage County for $400 for property in the town of Plover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The property was described as running from the village of Plover to Springville Mills and was adjacent to the Methodist Episcopal parsonage lot in Plover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That property was apparently the property Mathias and Catharine lived on in the 1860 Census, because a neighbor to them, according to the Census, was George W. Slater, 50, a Methodist \u201cpriest,\u201d born in New York; his wife Isabel, 46; and their two children, daughter Harriett, 18, and son Abbott, 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ela was listed in the 1880 Census records as 39 years old, born in Illinois, living in Enumeration District No. 84 in Santa Barbara, Calif., and working in farming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With him was his wife, Ida A. Mitchell, 29, and their three children, son Clarence A.,7; son Fred F., 5; and daughter, Irene M., 11 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means Ela got married in the decade of the 1870s, and a further check found a record of California marriage license with Ela Mitchell marrying Ida A. Young on Aug. 29, 1871, in Alameda, Calif.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about Ela\u2019s mother. Again, checking for Catherine Mitchell, only one 1880 Census record showed a \u201cKatherine Mitchele,\u201d age 65 (within Catherine\u2019s range), born in Pennsylvania (as other records indicated).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ancestry searches use first name, last name, year of birth and location (city or town, county and state) as parameters, with \u201cSuggested Records\u201d to check to possibly track or verify the individual as the one being sought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Ancestry compiles records used in genealogy, family members will link the records to that family as \u201cSuggested Records\u201d to assist other family members in their searches, just as the website \u201cFind A Grave\u201d will do links for family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKatherine\u201d is listed as a housekeeper in the same Enumeration District No. 84 in Santa Barbara as Ela, living in the household of Andrew Hugick, 57, a farmer and his seven children, four males ages 15-20, and three girls, ages 9-13.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The penmanship of the Census enumerator is hard to read in the entry for the head of household, but was deciphered as Hugick, the only entry for Hugick on Ancestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hugick household is No. 111, and the Ela Mitchell household is No. 153, so the two households are relatively close, four pages apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again searching for Ela Mitchell, there was a notice of an Ela C. Mitchell listed on a private family tree posted on Ancestry. The owner of that posting reported, however, \u201cI don\u2019t know any information on this individual. There is an Ela C. Mitchell in my family file as the father-in-law of a distant cousin.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search for Ela C. Mitchell living in Stevens Point also turned up a Stevens Point Daily Journal story on May 23, 1891, that reported Ela was in Stevens Point, reportedly to check the deed to the Public Square to see whether the land would be returned to the Mitchell heirs if it was no longer being used as a public park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reporter was unable to talk to Ela to verify whether the story \u201cbeing circulated to the above effect may be just idle conjecture.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A story in the Aug. 1, 1891, Journal stated a reporter spoke with Ela during another visit to Stevens Point and learned Ela was about to begin an action on behalf of Mathias\u2019 heirs for possession of the Public Square.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ela claimed the land belonged to the heirs. No such claim was ever filed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A further search of records in the Portage County Register of Deeds office, however, revealed another \u201cPower of Attorney\u201d filing for the Mitchell family, and that provided the clues about what happened to family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More about Mitchell and his family in Part IV<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Continued from previous week Mathias Mitchell spent at least two decades in the Stevens Point area.

Cate, one of Portage County\u2019s first attorneys who was later a circuit judge and served in Congress, wrote a history of Stevens Point for the 1896 edition of the City Directory and said Mitchell had the \u201chome and tavern\u201d completed by early spring and development of the Stevens Point community was mainly within the sites Mitchell had purchased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a brief history of Stevens Point published in the Stevens Point Journal July 20, 1907, Wayne Bentley wrote that the first hotel Mitchell built in Stevens Point was called The Raftman\u2019s Home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his book \u201cOur County, Our Story,\u201d a history of Portage County published in 1959, Malcolm Rosholt, said Mitchell built the first tavern house or hotel in the city along Main Street, approximately where Bank One is today, and received a license to operate on March 24, 1845, according to Portage County treasurer\u2019s records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who was this Mathias Mitchell?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search to correctly identify pioneers can be tedious, and impossible to verify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there may be enough clues to tentatively identify him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pioneer was a person of the era, an explorer and entrepreneur, a man born in the age of little recognition and record-keeping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an era where recording of events and individuals was regrettably non-existent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the only records available were governmental records, mainly dealing with property, or stories passed on by word of mouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the countryside was undeveloped, there were no newspapers or cameras to record what was going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Portage County\u2019s first newspaper, The Pinery, didn\u2019t start until Jan. 14, 1853, when Gen. Albert E. Ellis brought a newspaper press from Green Bay and began publishing a weekly newspaper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the advent of newspapers in Stevens Point didn\u2019t record what Mathias Mitchell was doing in Stevens Point and the surrounding area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteers in the Stevens Point area went through copies of The Pinery, the Stevens Point Journal, the Portage County and Stevens Point Gazette, The Plover Times and The Lumberman prior to 1886, indexing all the proper names to provide access to assist future researchers. The name of Mathias (or Matthias as it is sometimes spelled on land records) Mitchell isn\u2019t among the 8,549 names listed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, for today\u2019s readers and amateur historians, the internet has opened avenues to track individuals from the pioneer age, while also leaving a number of questions about the positive identity of individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias Mitchell wasn\u2019t a recluse who stepped forward to make a donation to the public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was active in the community as it expanded into the Stevens Point area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of Wisconsin along the Wisconsin River was determined through the Treaty of the Cedars in 1836, but the three-mile area on each side of the river was not surveyed until 1839-40 by Joshua Hathaway and the land was not offered for sale by the U.S. Government until 1844.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In anticipation of the potential development, hundreds of pioneers, who could be called squatters, moved into the area to stake out sites to purchase before they could legally buy and settle on the property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demand appeared to be so great that the U.S. Government got the Menomonee Nation to agree to the Treaty of Lake Poygan in 1848, which ceded all tribal land eastward between the Wisconsin River to the Fox River to the government, opening more land to pioneers for development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As U.S. territory expanded, so did the country\u2019s desire to know what it had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. Census was started by the federal government in 1790 to count every resident in the nation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Census would list the location of the household and name the head of every household and then enumerate every free person in the household according to sex and age bracket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1850 Census was the first to name every occupant of a household, with their gender, race, age, sex, birth year, birthplace, occupation, industry and value of real estate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1850 Census also identifies a \u201cMatthias\u201d Mitchell, age 37, as a citizen of the town of Stevens Point, Wis. He is a lumberman owning real estate valued at $4,000 and was born in Pennsylvania.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his household are his wife, Catherine, 35, who was also born in Pennsylvania; a daughter, Hester, 13, who was born in Indiana; a son, Eli, 9, who was born in Illinois; a daughter, Emeline, 6, who was born in Illinois; and a laborer, Henry Mosoon, 15, who was born in Michigan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Mitchell built the first hotel, there were at least two others in the downtown area. There were also a lot of boarding or rooming houses, buildings large enough to house more than five people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listed above and below \u201cMatthias\u201d on the Census are hotels. In the hotel above him, Peter Grover, 32 is the tavern keeper. Next is Celia Grover, 27, then Ann Brown, 50, then five children named Brown, ages 10-19, with the oldest listed as \u201claborer.\u201d After that are 18 men, all of them listed as laborers except one musician and one with no occupation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hotel below the Mitchell family has Francis Lamere, 37, listed as tavern keeper, then his wife, 38, and four children, ages 1-17. Then there\u2019s a male laborer, 45, and a female, 18, with no occupation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also two other hotels listed in the Census in the town of Stevens Point, which extended all the way north beyond the Lake DuBay area toward Wausau (then known as Big Bull Falls).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was on Main Street owned by Joseph B. Phelps and the other was owned by John DuBay at what is now the Lake DuBay area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s Portage County borders weren\u2019t set until 1856.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell was active in the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had school-age children, and he was among several residents in 1847 who petitioned for a school district in the town of Stevens Point known as Stevens Point School District Number Two. The school was built in 1850 on the north side of Clark Street, the site of a municipal parking lot behind the Portage County Public Library today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>School District Number One was in Grand Rapids (today\u2019s Wisconsin Rapids) which was part of Portage County at that time. Wood County was formed in 1856.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell didn\u2019t contain his development ideas only to Stevens Point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a lumberman, he was also involved in sawmills, including one on the Little Eau Pleine River in the town of Eau Pleine in the 1840s and 1850s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a new road was extended south along the route of old Highway 51 (County Trunk BB) from Plover to Buena Vista (near the former community of Keene) in 1855, Mitchell built a tavern-house, called Mitchell\u2019s Tavern or Mitchell\u2019s Farm Stand. The site was near today\u2019s Moore Barn at BB at Highway 54 in the town of Stockton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Portage County Register of Deeds Office contains thousands of property records, and Mitchell is listed as an individual on 109 of those documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example of the discrepancies caused by spelling, 65 of those records list him as Mathias, with the remainder listing him as Matthias or both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More about Mitchell and his family in part III<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Part II in a series Mathias Mitchell was a mystery man when he came to Portage County and purchased two sites of approximately 80 acres in Stevens Point in January 1845 that would become the base of development in the downtown area of Stevens Point.

Johnson filed the claim to Lot 3, which was farther south, an area that includes the site of the Stevens Point Dam at Pixelle Specialty Solutions mill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnson\u2019s claim to Lot 3 triggered some animosity. Abraham Brawley, another pioneer, had built a log cabin and intended to build a sawmill on the site after registering a claim for the property once the government began offering the land for sale. However, Johnson got to the land office first, but he and Brawley worked out an amicable agreement about the mill and the house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brawley, a former member of the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, then got the Legislature to authorize him to construct a dam across the Wisconsin River at Stevens Point in 1845.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moses M. Strong, a well-known Mineral Point lawyer and land speculator, filed the first two land claims on the west side of the Wisconsin River in Stevens Point,.He filed entries on the government lot at the west end of the Clark Street bridge on March 18, 1845, and on the lot south of it, at the west end of the present Stevens Point dam on Nov. 11, 1845.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Mullarky and then Mullarky and Maddy together received their patents, they had already sold their properties to Mathias Mitchell, which, technically speaking, was illegal. But it was a common practice in those days, one of many rules honored more than in strict observance of the laws, because of the long delays in receiving the patents for the land grants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mitchell purchased Lot 1 for $200 and Lot 2 for $150 on Jan. 1, 1845, according to records in the Portage County Register of Deeds Office.He borrowed $700 from James M. Campbell to develop that property in 1846.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, he filed a plat for development in the downtown Stevens Point area, including a 1.5-acre segment as a public square, an area common in New England states. In 1851 he filed a revised plat, making minor changes to the original document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullarky continued speculating in land, moving to Iowa in the 1850s and purchasing land. The 1860 U.S. Census shows he was farming in Cedar Falls in Black Hawk County, Iowa, with real estate valued at $90,000 and personal estate valued at $15,000. He died in 1863 and is buried in Cedar Falls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maddy continued to live in the Stevens Point area and is recorded in the 1855 Wisconsin State Census, but no other references were found about him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johnson, who initially owned Lot 3, died in 1848.\u00a0 He became involved in financing with Moses Strong, the Mineral Point attorney who owned the property on the west side, and Strong wound up acquiring the property in 1847. Strong never lived in Stevens Point, but he spent time here because of his financial involvement in land and sawmills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what about Mathias Mitchell, who gave Stevens Point its historic Public Square that now bears his name. He has become a mystery man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Siebert, president of the Portage County Historical Society, told a statewide television audience on Oct. 25, 2021, that the city really doesn\u2019t know anything about Mathias Mitchell, other than he donated the Public Square to the city in 1847 and submitted the first plat for settlement of the future city that became Stevens Point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking in the premiere broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television of the history program \u201cWisconsin Hometown Stories: Stevens Point,\u201d Siebert said, \u201cWe really don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 175 years after the Public Square was deeded to Stevens Point for use by the public, the tradition of a farmers market continues at the location in the downtown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Area residents still go there daily during the warmer months to purchase flowers, fresh produce and other farm products. The square can be a beehive of activity, especially on Saturdays, as residents arrive to purchase freshly picked produce and other items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While younger people may associate the Square more with the number of taverns that ring its boundaries, the area got its start as a gathering place for the public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The area was certainly a gathering space for the early pioneers. The point that jutted into the Wisconsin River from the west end of Main Street signaled a resting place for weary travelers paddling their way north to Big Bull Falls (now Wausau) and points north. Or those returning to civilization in the southern parts of the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The earliest pioneers in Stevens Point may have settled there, such as Mullarky, Maddy, Brawley, the Shaurette family, a man with the last name of Allen, Mitchell and others. They may initially have been squatters because the land wasn\u2019t open to development until after the survey of the area was completed by Joshua Hathaway in 1839-40.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those pioneers may have used Stevens\u2019 warehouse, or built a cabin nearby. Brawley built a cabin at Shaurette Rapids, near the present location of the Stevens Point dam, and his family lived in it for several months. His agreement with Johnson allowed the family to continue to live there for a few years before they moved elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Mitchell now owned Lots 1 and 2 and he would build a home for his family and continue to reside in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More about Mitchell in Part II<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter The first piece of property acquired on a land grant in Portage County was downtown Stevens Point and included the landmarks Mathias Mitchell Public Square and the point along the Wisconsin River known as George Stevens\u2019 point because he reportedly built or owned a warehouse there.

Jim used to umpire softball with us.<\/p>\n<p>He said it was a long shot, but he wanted to know if I could line up a speaker for an event at UWSP. A Communications Department prof was retiring. (I think it was either Dan Houlihan or C.Y.Allen).<\/p>\n<p>I told Mr. Moe that I\u2019d give it a try.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s go back to Mr. Remmel.<\/p>\n<p>Lee Remmel covered or worked for the Green Bay Packers for 62 years. In 1945, he was a sportswriter for the Green Bay Press Gazette. Remmel was the only sportswriter who covered all of the Packer coaches from the first (Curly Lambeau) to Bart Starr. He went to work in the Packers\u2019 front office in 1974 as the Public Relations Director. He was one of twelve people honored by the NFL for covering the first 40 Super Bowls.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Lee was named the first historian of the Green Bay Packers. He retired in 2007 at age 83.<\/p>\n<p>Lee was inducted into the Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame in 1996. The Lambeau Field press box was named \u201cThe Lee Remmel Press Box\u201d in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Remmel died in 2015. Brett Favre said \u201cLee is a Packer icon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s go back to that Communication Dept. event. You can see where this is going, right?<\/p>\n<p>I picked up the phone and dialed Lee\u2019s number in Green Bay. Back then, you could talk directly to the person you were trying to reach.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHello. This is Lee Remmel,\u201d said Lee Remmel.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Lee, Tim Sullivan from Stevens Point here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lee said: \u201cHi, Tim. What\u2019s up?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I said: \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know how to say this, but the Comm. Department at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point is having an event honoring someone in a few weeks, and I\u2019m supposed to line up a speaker.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remmel: \u201cWhat day and time is it, and when do you want me there?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I said: \u201cUh, Lee, did I mention that the speaker won\u2019t be paid anything?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lee replied: \u201cLike I said. When do you want me there?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s class, folks.<\/p>\n<p>So Packer Legend Lee Remmel drove up from Green Bay, and he delivered a great speech which got a standing ovation. And he didn\u2019t ask for a dime.<\/p>\n<p>He used a bunch of hand-written notes on a yellow legal pad. And he told several Vince Lombardi stories. And after his speech, he let me have his notes.<\/p>\n<p>And I still have the notes.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s like Brett Favre said. Lee Remmel was a Packer icon.

The staff included veteran reporters who sat through their share of meetings with wacky moments that often weren\u2019t shared with the general public because they didn\u2019t fit with the subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>The column was introduced with the paragraph: \u201cHere at The Gazette, we have our share of wacky moments. We decided to share some of them. If you don\u2019t like the \u2018humor,\u2019 then kindly refer to the title of this column.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The title of the column changed throughout the years whenever The Gazette changed its price so that it remained the same as the price of a single edition.<\/p>\n<p>Some of those initial stories, with the headlines in capital letters to tell them apart, included:<br \/>\nVISITING THE STARS: Outside water meters eliminate the need for meter readers to enter basements, but meter readers can tell all kinds of stories about entering basements.<\/p>\n<p>One meter reader said he will never forget all the stars he saw on the visit to one home. He finished reading the meter and started out of the basement. Then WHAM. He woke up later lying on the basement floor, looking up at the low beam that leveled him like a clothesline tackle.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT OXYMORON: A Plover man tells us that his wife once called him at lunch time and instructed him to \u201ctake a roast out of the freezer to \u2018unthaw\u2019 it.\u201d He informed her that to \u201cunthaw\u201d anything is a physical impossibility, and, besides, it is an oxymoron as well.<\/p>\n<p>She told him that the only \u201cmoron\u201d was him and that if the roast didn\u2019t come out of the freezer pronto, he would be taking her out for lobster. The roast was \u201cunthawing\u201d within moments of hanging up the phone.<\/p>\n<p>The stories often relied on readers submitting information about incidents they witnessed, such as these:<br \/>\nA PUSHBUTTON WORLD: A local tavern\u2019s pay phone would be labeled an antique by some of today\u2019s youngsters. The phone has a rotary dial instead of the now-common pushbutton models. One day two kids who missed their bus wanted to use the phone but didn\u2019t know how. They apparently hadn\u2019t seen a phone with a rotary dial before.<\/p>\n<p>A SMALL MATTER: One chap likened the rapid shrinkage in snow depth this week to a similar phenomenon that occurs when those crazy male polar bear club members jump into the icy waters on New Year\u2019s Day.<\/p>\n<p>In March of 2000, the city of Stevens Point was contemplating having two polling places in the 9th Ward in Stevens Point, one on each side of the river because the ward is split by the Wisconsin River. State law prohibited more than one polling location, but the Clark Street bridge had been removed, so residents would have to drive several miles to Highway HH to use the new HH bridge to get across the river to the polling place.<\/p>\n<p>The state later authorized the two locations, rejecting a Gazette recommendation that the city put the polling place on a boat in the middle of the river, with the city furnishing boats to ferry voters back and forth to the polling place.<\/p>\n<p>The column also offered The Gazette an opportunity to inform readers about our own foibles, such as this one: \u201cTHE LAST WILL BE FIRST: Oops. Someone pressed the wrong button on the computer and eliminated the first names of Gazette subscribers this week. We hoped to resurrect the first names by the time the papers rolled off the presses, but if you get a Gazette in the mail addressed to your last name only,<\/p>\n<p>it\u2019s not a matter of lack of respect, rather a lack of ability.

The group had plans of adding a massive indoor go-kart track, a laser tag complex, batting cages and potentially a mini-golf course.

The 2001 rendition of the fair boasted a record attendance of 15,300 people and even including some traveling from as far away as Senegal and Japan.

Space for an additional store would also be included on the lease for a store to be named later.

The play\u2019s run lasted from Dec. 8th until Dec. 15th. This rendition of the holiday classic was the second time UWSP had chosen to perform the play in recent years. This version of the play promised to be more magical and more purposely scary as an attempt to make the payoff of the Scrooge\u2019s change of heart feel more earned. Director Gary Olson added that he hoped that the play would \u201cmake you feel good and ready for the holiday season.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>10 Years Ago<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A local family gained some notoriety with their victory in a National Boys and Girls Club competition held in Los Angeles. The Porters competed in the \u201cGame Plan for The Mind, Body and Soul Challenge\u201d and ended up winning the competition because of their significant lifestyle changes to become a healthier family as a whole. Their victory earned them a trip to the U.S. Olympic Training Facility in Colorado Springs, CO. Local Boys and Girls Club administrator Danielle Goska nominated the Porters for the event and said \u201cThey are a loving family and they put their heart and soul into everything they do, just like they did when participating in our Bike-A-Thon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A recent Hollywood movie featured a story written by the wife of a local resident. Born in Rosholt, Andy Lautenbach would go on to marry Kaui Hart Hemmings. Hemmings would later pen the book that would inspire the screenplay behind the George Clooney led film, \u201cThe Descendants.\u201d Kaui and Andy were also given bit parts in the film. Kaui played Clooney\u2019s assistant in the movie and even got a line of dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>Andy was given a small non-speaking role. Both Kaui and Andy were invited to attend the premiere of the movie in Hollywood.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Lucas Jagodzinski 100 Years Ago Local furniture makers and manufacturers in the Midwest decided to gather in Stevens Point for their annual convention.

Air travel has become, in many ways, as common as a road trip in today\u2019s modern economy. November is an especially good month to appreciate the magic of aviation given that November is National Aviation History Month. Aside from aviation history being very cool and interesting, a good reason to honor the month-long holiday coincides with Veteran\u2019s day. Without veterans and the air travel innovations made during many of the wars that America has fought in, air travel as we know it and our country in general would not be what we know it as today.<\/p>\n<p>War in general, has yielded a great deal of innovations in the aviation industry. World War 1 occurred just years after the Wright Brothers flew the first plane at Kitty Hawk. World War 1 encouraged inventors and innovators to build safer, more stable planes that could withstand heavy amounts of damage and lengthy flight times. World War 2 saw the first use of jet fueled planes and the first use of planes as a means of high-speed travel. These innovations and the many more that occurred on the battlefield represent some of the many things that we have our veterans past and present to be thankful for. Veterans Day is just one day in the month of November, but National Aviation month should also be a reminder of our veterans\u2019 contributions to the country and world we live in today.<\/p>\n<p>One special way we use aviation to remember and honor veterans and their contributions to our country is the Never Forgotten Honor Flights. This Wausau based organization began operations in 2009 with the sole purpose of honoring Veterans and their contributions to our country through a special flight to our nation\u2019s capital. These flights, which transport veterans via plane to Washington D.C., allow veterans to view monuments and memorials honoring their contributions to our country. At present, the organization has hubs for Honor Flights in 125 cities and 45 states. At the moment, Never Forgotten Honor Flights have been paused due to the pandemic, but new flights are set to resume in 2022. For more information about the Never Forgotten Honor Flights, go to https:\/\/neverforgottenhonorflight.com\/. Veterans Day and<\/p>\n<p>Aviation History Month and the Honor Flights all represent ways to remember and honor veterans for their hard work, but it\u2019s important to remember that this can be done any time of year and any day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Lucas Jagodzinski PORTAGE COUNTY &#8211; November, it\u2019s a time when many of us are planning trips to see loved ones around the country and for some of us, relatives around the world.

The paint shop in Stevens Point oversaw all three of the eventual color changes the Wisconsin Central would undergo. The paint shop in Stevens Point repainted all of the train cars in the company on 3 separate occasions between 1871 and 1889. The hub in Stevens Point also possessed the region\u2019s first train whistle. The whistle is said to have cause many complaints as it was rumored to have been heard as far Waupaca and been known to rattle windows and cause plates to crash off of shelves.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the success of the railroad came a few setbacks. Six fires occurred between 1876 and 1881 at railroad facilities. Most of the fires were the result of wood being the main construction material used in combination with inadequate firefighting capabilities due to lack of water close to the facilities. Two buildings were lost in the fires. A wooden blacksmith shop and the wooden paint shop. Both of these buildings were eventually replaced with stone buildings. Both of which were still in use as of the 1990s. Other upgrades included the building of a new depot in 1882.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part two of on ongoing series By Lucas Jagodzinski Wisconsin Central completed work on its principal railroad shop in Stevens Point in 1876.

Lumber would be cut from the expansive forests north of the city and transported via the Wisconsin River down to Stevens Point. While the river provided a viable option for transport, it was also very dangerous and not very efficient. In response, citizens sought a new mode of transportation and found one in the emerging railroad industry. As early as 1858, talks began on what it would take to bring a railroad company to Stevens Point. With a population of around 1,800 people, the city expanded its push for a railroad in the 1860\u2019s. $500,000 in stock and bonds for the railroad were sold before a single train ever came to town.<\/p>\n<p>In 1871, the Wisconsin Central Railroad began construction of a 10-stall roundhouse in Stevens Point. The company completed construction of the roundhouse in 1872. The first steam engine arrived in Stevens Point on Nov. 15, 1871. Crowds gathered to see the engine amidst the promise of faster travel and cheaper transportation rates for freight and passengers. Train travel promised to cut travel times to a quarter of what was previously possible. The Wisconsin Central Railroad or WC began to create new routes branching out of Stevens Point.

The event also hosted a special jewelry auction, a cash prize raffle and a silent auction.

By 1961, 20 percent of the East German population had left the country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On June 4, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev said he would sign a treaty that would restrict U.S., British and French access to Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>In a July 25, 1961, address to the nation, President John F.

The United States, he said, \u2018will seek peace, but will not surrender,\u2019\u201d Faltinson explained.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c(The president) asked Congress for an additional $3.25 billion to raise six new divisions for the Army and two for the Marine Corps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKennedy sought an increase in the active-component Army from 875,000 to 1 million troops, along with large increases to the Air Force and Navy. He planned, too, to call up the National Guard and Reserves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 13, East German President Walter Ulbricht ordered the closing of the border between East and West Germany and construction of the Berlin Wall.<\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 30, the president called for the mobilization of 148,000 guardsmen and reservists and tripled the draft calls.<\/p>\n<p>One week later, the Red Arrow division was notified that they might be called up, and on Sept. 19, 4,000 Wisconsin guardsmen were notified that they would need to leave their homes, families, and jobs to report to Fort Lewis, WA, by Oct. 15.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter about a week at home station, an advance party flew to Fort Lewis, Wash., to prepare for the division\u2019s arrival. They cleaned barracks that had been mothballed since World War II and, in between half-mile hikes to the nearest mess hall, cut the cantonment area\u2019s knee-high grass,\u201d Faltinson explained.<\/p>\n<p>Back in Wisconsin, local guardsmen were making preparations at home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to walk guard around the armory up there until we left,\u201d recalled Norb Konrardy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce we were called up, we loaded the equipment and everything on the railroad cars.<\/p>\n<p>We had to load all of our trucks and howitzers,\u201d added Joel Stack.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome of us rode the train and some didn\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those riding the rail lines marched from the armory to the rail station and spent three days on the train to get to Fort Lewis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn scenes reminiscent of those 21 years earlier, thousands tearfully watched their community\u2019s soldiers board one of 17 troop trains that would carry them into service for the nation,\u201d Faltinson added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTwo thousand more journeyed via automobile across the Rocky Mountains in an era before interstate highways, and 1,500 experienced their first airplane rides on a chartered commercial carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConditions were cramped as 4,000 reservists trickled in to fill out the division\u2019s strength to near 14,000.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith classrooms pressed into barracks, training shifted outdoors during the area\u2019s notorious rainy season.

He played a number of instruments before finally working his way up to the drums.<\/p>\n<p>Wesley proudly reports that Spaulding was the real talent behind the Drum and Bugle Corps, and calls his friend quite the bugle player.<\/p>\n<p>At that time, Drum and Bugle Corps were known for the precision marching and maneuvering that University bands are known for today.<\/p>\n<p>The Rapids Scouts started out very small, playing with used instruments. But Spaulding and Wesley report that thanks to their ambitious director, Robert Suerth, they were able to improve quickly and in two years they had raised enough funds to purchase all new instruments.<\/p>\n<p>Whats more, they were rising in the ranks. Drum Corps were broken up into A, B, and C groups.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were at the top of B corps and we really didn\u2019t want to go into A corps, because we were at the top,\u201d Wesley said.<\/p>\n<p>But they did move up into the A group and while they didn\u2019t win as many competitions it is still a point of pride for both Wesley and Spaulding that a little Drum and Bugle Corps from Wisconsin Rapids made it as far as they did.<\/p>\n<p>The precision taught both men attention to detail.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo me, what I took out of the Corps was discipline,\u201d Wesley said. \u201cI learned respect in there, it was almost like being in the military.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They reported that one time in a competition, the Rapids Scouts came in fractions of a point behind the Madison Scouts because one boy in their troop had left a piece of lint on his shirt.<\/p>\n<p>But for all the care and attention to detail Spaulding and Wesley put into the Bugle Corps, they still managed to have a good time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was fun because you did it yourself. Nobody could help you &#8211; because nobody could. You either did it or you didn\u2019t do it. You had to have the ambition,\u201d Spaulding said.<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 1960, sixty members of the Corps headed out west for seventeen days, where they visited fifteen cities, seven states and covered over 2,500 miles.<\/p>\n<p>Included in the seven states were Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Colorado.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the highlight of our career,\u201d Wesley said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to touring as the Drum and Bugle Corps, the members also got to spend a few nights camping under the stars and visit places like Pikes Peak and the Black Hills of South Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>Some Bugle Corps that the Rapids Scouts competed against back when Wesley and Spaulding were members are still around today, but most of them, including the Rapids Scouts, have disbanded.<\/p>\n<p>Some Wisconsin-based scouts that are still playing include the Madison Scouts, who are a world-class competitive drum and bugle corps and the Racine Scouts are the oldest continuously active drum and bugle corps in North America.<\/p>\n<p>Wesley still plays the drums today with his grandson, Wesley.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Precision marching in Wisconsin Rapids<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":114489,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[2459],"tags":[3720],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

The grounds were later sold to the Wood County Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Association, who ran a fair on the site for about two decades.<\/p>\n<p>The land was sold to the city of Grand Rapids, who built a high school on the site and developed Lincoln Athletic Field. In 1926, the field was designated for general community use with a goal to create \u201cthe finest community recreation grounds in the entire state of Wisconsin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Infused with a large donation from area businessman, Isaac P. Witter, and city and school district funds, a south side grandstand was added to the park.<\/p>\n<p>In 1933, the common council approved the 1934 budget, which included financing of an entrance to the park, along with a bandshell. The entrance included restrooms, a ticket booth, shower rooms, and a furnace room. The new amenities were dedicated during the city\u2019s Fourth of July celebration that year.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-114395 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SP-Rafters-1-210430-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SP-Rafters-1-210430-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SP-Rafters-1-210430-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SP-Rafters-1-210430-130x130.jpg 130w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/SP-Rafters-1-210430.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>At the end of the year, the park reported 50,000 visitors, with about 10,500 spectators there to see the city\u2019s baseball team.<\/p>\n<p>Lights were added and the park was renamed \u201cWitter Field,\u201d in honor of benefactor Isaac Witter, as the field continued to grow larger and larger crowds.<\/p>\n<p>However, the open access of the field lent to spectators taking advantage of the set up. Cars lined an area on Chestnut Street and around the field to watch from the safety of their vehicle. Officials reported about 30-40 vehicles watching from outside of the fence on any given night.<\/p>\n<p>It was also reported that several hundred more spectators than the number passing through the gate were often observed in the bleachers. Visiting clubs sometimes accused the club of playing with paid admission totals.<\/p>\n<p>The same year, the park became known as Witter Field, the Chicago White Sox started an affiliate in the city called the Wisconsin Rapids White Sox. Spring training for the team began at the athletic field on April 27.<\/p>\n<p>Thirty-one players arrived to join manager, Frank Parenti in Wisconsin Rapids, with 26 of them traveling via Wisconsin Rapids Athletic club bus.<\/p>\n<p>Among the players under contract were 12 pitchers, two catchers, six in fielders, and nine out fielders, including Carl Hopp and Earl Harding.<\/p>\n<p>But activities thousands of miles away would take the \u201cboys of summer\u201d far from central Wisconsin and put a pause on affiliate operations in Wisconsin Rapids.<\/p>\n<p>Continued next week<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>History of Wisconsin Rapids Rafters, part 1<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":114394,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[2459,10,2403],"tags":[2402],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

Those without their own property in which to reside were doomed to struggle in the new country.<br \/>\nWhile many took work in industrialized cities to earn the funds to buy the land, many others came with small amounts of savings to buy cheap land and work it into an operating homestead. While it was hard labor, it is something Polish farmers knew well.<br \/>\nAt the heart of it all in Portage County was a place called \u201cPolish Corner,\u201d which in the late 1860s consisted of two churches \u2013 St. Joseph\u2019s and St. Martin\u2019s \u2013 and three taverns. Today the area is known as Ellis.<br \/>\nIn 1870, Father Joseph Dabrowski was assigned to St. Joseph\u2019s and struggled with the nearby taverns. He soon made the decision to move the parish away. With land donated by the McGreer family, a location was plotted out on a 20-acre parcel to the east.<br \/>\n\u201cDabrowski announced the move on a Sunday and the next day a crew of parishioners assembled to dismantle St. Joseph\u2019s,\u201d Michael Goc wrote in \u201cNative Realm.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cThe work was fairly easy since the church was a wooden frame building. It was easy to knock apart and reassemble even though frame construction was a new style of architecture the Poles had never seen until they came to the United States. Dabrowski\u2019s crew was not without opposition. A gang opposed to the move threatened the workers with angry words, axes and stones. One woman threw herself on the church bell after it had been removed from its tower and set on the ground. She clung to the bell and shouted insults at Dabrowski\u2019s supporters. Through it all, the pastor urged his people to remain quiet and keep working. In a week, they took the church down, loaded it onto wagons and moved it off to the hilltop that Dabrowski had christened Polonia.<br \/>\n\u201cThe church was reassembled and, in September 1872, the new parish was dedicated to honor the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin. The parishioners also built a rectory for Dabrowski. It was a two-story building with living quarters upstairs and a large room on the first floor that the pastor turned into a school. Once again, he called on the McGreer family for help and young Mary McGreer volunteered to conduct English classes. So it came to pass that the first teacher in the first Polish Catholic parochial school in Portage County was a convert of Scottish descent.<br \/>\n\u201cThe Polish teachers soon came to Polonia.

He came home in November, and we were married in June,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The couple married June 1, 1946, at St. Stanislaus Catholic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents redid their upstairs; they made it into an apartment for us on Brilowski Road,\u201d she explained.<\/p>\n<p>A son, Edward, and a daughter, Brenda, were born on Brilowski Road.<br \/>\nIn 1959, Bruno and Gladys built their own home in Stevens Point, in which Gladys still resides.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno worked as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, while Gladys was the office manager for a company called Weber Tackle, which shut down in 1978.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of the tackle was being made in the foreign countries. They couldn\u2019t sell anything here, because everything was so cheap. They could make a dozen of them for a dollar. Here they were maybe a dollar a piece,\u201d she said.<br \/>\nGladys then worked part-time at Sentry Insurance before retiring.<\/p>\n<p>After her son and daughter were grown, Gladys took up bowling and golf, qualifying for the Channel 7 tournament for a total of 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>In later years, as her husband\u2019s health began to deteriorate, Gladys helped care for the man who seemed to be invincible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI could write a book on that guy. It is just unreal what he went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had more than nine lives; he had the lives of two cats.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The lives of two cats<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cBruno\u2019s parents came from Poland to the United States. His parents and siblings lived in Posen, Illinois, until he was three years old. His parents were very poor and got swindled out of money by a stockbroker named Rozner, who convinced them to sell and buy a farm in Stevens Point,\u201d Gladys said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Maziarka died at age 54, when Bruno was 16 years old. His dad moved back to Chicago, leaving Bruno alone on that farm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bruno enlisted in the United States Army one year later. He and a friend drove to Milwaukee in a Model T Ford, with 15 cents in his pocket.<\/p>\n<p>He then did his Army training and maneuvers in Georgia.<\/p>\n<p>One day while sitting in his pup tent under a set of pines, an electrical storm snuck up on the troop.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was writing a letter when an electric bolt came down and struck one of the pine trees, traveled into the tent and struck Bruno, throwing him out. All of his Army buddies started praying for him as his heart had stopped. Medics were called and they gave him CPR and he finally came to,\u201d Gladys said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter training, he left on a ship to Europe. While on this ship, he came down with pneumonia, where they gave him kerosene to drink. They got to London and (he) was taken to a hospital there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While recovering, Bruno was separated from his unit. He later had to set out on his own to track them down in France, where he would operate as a radio dispatcher.<\/p>\n<p>While in the service, he was stationed at Normandy Beach; Rhine Beach; Ardennes, France; central Europe; and was in the Battle of the Bulge.<\/p>\n<p>He earned the Victory Medal, American Theater Ribbon, European-African-Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon, with one silver Battle Star and three overseas service medals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe always volunteered, because all of the other guys had families,\u201d Gladys said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring one of the wars, he was hit with shrapnel in his hand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis brother Edward was a paratrooper; he was shot down over Germany and ended up in a concentration camp where he died from lack of proper care,\u201d she recalled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBruno was stationed a couple of miles from there and was going to visit him the next day; however, (Edward) died before he got there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bruno was discharged Dec. 5, 1945.<\/p>\n<p>In 1986, Bruno had a major health setback when a heart valve ruptured.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt that time, there was only a 25 percent chance of surviving, but he did it,\u201d Gladys recalled.<\/p>\n<p>Ten years later, he had five bypasses. He recovered, but Bruno was not done with the challenges life would bring him. Years later, he was headed for more surgery.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe had surgery on diverticulitis pockets\u2026He was bleeding internally, so they had to open him up again,\u201d Gladys explained.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno continued to have complications, but persevered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was quite a character; he still would go fishing and hunting and all of that stuff. He didn\u2019t give up,\u201d she said.<br \/>\n\u201cAnd then in ice fishing, he fell through the ice twice. His buddies had to save him.<\/p>\n<p>After numerous complications, Bruno passed away in May 2013, but left behind a legacy of bravery and strength, as well as the heart of the woman he met on Brilowski Road.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 Growing up on Brilowski Road conjures memories of barley soup and straw mattresses for 94-year-old Gladys Maziarka.

The hard-working farmers were willing to take on the back-breaking work to tame the land and make it fertile, in exchange for a low purchase price.<br \/>\nIn the 1890s, the large Polish settlement continued to grow, spilling into the towns of Hull and Dewey where they created a community named in honor of the Old Country \u2013 Torun. It was at this time that early developer, John J. Heffron began targeting Polish immigrants as he developed a planned settlement in the town of Belmont. Ahead of his time, Heffron created a spec home and offered low-cost financing.<br \/>\nBy the turn of the century, one-third of Portage County\u2019s population was of Polish heritage, and they kept coming, until the advent of World War I.<br \/>\nWith their arrival, they also brought their knowledge of raising potatoes and rye, and the two soon became the county\u2019s leading crops.<br \/>\nThe sandy soil in the area was the perfect setting for a good potato crop. Rye was seen as a staple for baking bread in the early days of the settlement.<br \/>\nAs many emigrants were familiar with the log construction back in Poland, most family settlements started out with a log home. A typical log home was one story high, with a pitched roof to allow for a sizable attic. The homes were created with tight-fitted timber, with precise dove-tailed corners. The houses often had no interior walls or were divided into two simple rooms.<br \/>\nIn the new country, they quickly took to the \u201cstovewood\u201d method of construction. The method used logs of identical size stacked similar to a woodpile and secured in mortar.<br \/>\nSocial events often centered around the church, with dances held in barns, granaries, or outdoors, until public facilities were built.<br \/>\nDancing was very popular among the immigrants, with a string ensemble providing the necessary waltzes and folk music from the Old Country. As the concertina became popular and ethnic music styles integrated, the polka came to the forefront.<br \/>\nContinued in next week\u2019s edition<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt Part IV continued from previous edition PORTAGE COUNTY \u2013 Portage County saw the rise of steeples across the landscape over several decades, as emigrants nurtured their religious communities in America.

With the introduction of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, came many more jobs. The building of more and more homes and stores also brought work for those who needed another avenue for revenue.<br \/>\nIn the old country, life revolved around church. In Wisconsin, the parish was the center of the community, with many of them Roman Catholic.

By 1910, Wisconsin had more than 70 predominantly Polish parishes; by 1940, there were over 100.<br \/>\nA large, magnificent church was a sign of devotion and pride. The Polish emigrants built large, imposing churches in Wisconsin. Though poor, the settlers sacrificed personal finances and long hours of work to build the churches themselves.<br \/>\nInstead of referencing neighborhoods and locations, emigrants would often reference the parish they belonged to as an indication of where they were from.<br \/>\nChurches also took the early role in educating children.<br \/>\nIn 1856, St. Stephen\u2019s church was built in Stevens Point. In 1857, Father Pollak established St. Martin\u2019s, a mission church. Both parishes were largely Irish-German.<br \/>\nIn the mid-1860s, the Polish community petitioned the Milwaukee bishop to charter a separate church staffed by a Polish priest, which they named \u201cSt. Joseph\u2019s.\u201d<br \/>\nIn 1871, St. Casimir Parish was founded in Casimir, and two years later, the first parochial school opened at St. Stephen\u2019s in Stevens Point.<br \/>\nThe next several decades saw new churches and parochial schools pop up throughout Portage County, as immigration boomed and communities continued to form.<br \/>\nContinued in next week\u2019s edition<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt Continued from previous edition PORTAGE COUNTY \u2013 While many Polish immigrants headed to big cities to make quick money to either send back to the \u201cOld Country\u201d or create a new home in America, those emigrants settling around the town of Sharon in Portage County were mostly farmers who came to develop the difficult land.

No dissent from the opinion that these were the earliest immigrants have been encountered and no records have been found to contradict it. As to the dates of their arrivals, tradition, even among those who then came as children with their parents, is at variance. These facts, however, are sufficiently settled by papers on file in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court in Stevens Point, where the declaration of intention to become a citizen made by Koziczkowski states that he arrived in 1857. The papers of the others named give the date of their coming as 1858, and, corroborating this evidence are the baptismal records of the Zynda family with the same year thereupon, furnished by the parish priest upon their departure for America and still in their possession,\u201d it reads.<br \/>\nFamilies arriving the following year, included:\u00a0 Dzwonkowsky, Wojak, Lukaszewitz, Jazdzewski, Green, and Werochowski. Peter Kronopeski also came to Portage County somewhere in that time frame.<br \/>\n\u201cThe pioneer of this early group of immigrants, Koziczkowski, had been the owner of a small farm in the region of Dantzic, West Prussia. He realized that the economic future of his nine children was dark and, having read of America, sold his farm and started for the New World without knowing his destination. Arrived in Chicago, he heard of cheap lands to be had on the upper Wisconsin River. In Milwaukee he learned more, for there was at that time a movement among the Germans to take up lands in Marathon County. Proceeding in this direction, Koziczkowski arrived at Stevens Point in September 1857, with but fifty dollars in money. He left his family in Stevens Point while he went to Wausau to look at land, which proved unsatisfactory because too heavily wooded. Returning, he spent the winter (1857-58) in Stevens Point, and in the following summer worked for farmers a few miles east of the city. In the meantime, he had written to friends at home, and the three families of Klesmit, Platta and Zynda had found their way to Portage County and were employed in the same neighborhood.\u201d<br \/>\nThe letters to their home country must have been effective, as by 1870, the town of Sharon had a population of 928 \u2013 with only 50 families of Polish descent.

She was an avid fly fisher when the sport was predominantly men, and noticed her imported European flies were not attracting the local Wisconsin fish. She took to the lands and crafted her own, flies with local feathers, animal fur, and other native materials.<br \/>\nPBS Wisconsin Director of Education Alyssa Tsagong noted that American history for children and adults doesn\u2019t need to be about \u201csomeplace else,\u201d but it can be in our own cities and villages.<br \/>\n\u201cHistory doesn\u2019t need to be abstract and something that happened \u2018someplace else\u2019 \u2013 the relevance that local history offers for learners of every age creates a pathway for deeper understanding of how our communities were established and have changed over time, giving context to the present,\u201d Tsagong said. \u201cLocal history becomes a gateway to expand your knowledge about history generally and to create cross-generational connections.\u201d<br \/>\nFrost would later open a fly tackle shop in Stevens Point, using only her initials \u201cC.J.,\u201d instead of her full name to avoid discrimination as a woman business owner. Her products caught the attention of fishermen across the nation, putting Stevens Point on the map as the \u201dFly Tackle Capital of the World.\u201d<br \/>\nBut Frost didn\u2019t stop there, she continued to grow her shop\u2019s reputation, and hired mostly women to tie her flies, helping shape social norms and standards of the time in an industry controlled mostly by men.<br \/>\nTsagong said that the team at PBS learned about Frost from one of their public listening sessions held at the Portage County Public Library in Stevens Point.<br \/>\nThe Wisconsin Biographies piece is intended for students, grades 3-8. A digital book, image gallery, and educator guide are also available on PBSWisconsinEducation.org.<br \/>\n\u201cCarrie Frost: Fly Fishing Boss\u201d is an educational component of the upcoming documentary PBS Wisconsin Hometown Stories: Stevens Point.

Mostly memories and some photos remain, but you can still imagine a bit what it would have been like to walk through the enormous beautiful ornate brass doors of the original entrance. The doors and lamp posts were thoughtfully salvaged by those who realized their importance. Saved by local historian John Anderson and stored in the basement of the Old Main Building at the University, the doors safely sat and collected dust for a few decades. The lamp posts continued to be used and were moved to the front of the new Charles M White Library. Later, the lamp post silhouette was incorporated into the library logo.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>When the third and present library was built in 1992, the brass doors were dusted off and brought out of storage to be reunited with the lamp posts at the new library entrance.<\/p>\n<p>The entrance to the Pinery Room meeting space, specifically designed to hold the doors, gave the library a beautiful grand entrance once again. Unfortunately, the transom that hangs above the doors is not original and it is a fabricated replicate based on the door design.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Today, the original hangs in the home of a private citizen, and at the time was not available for public display.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The replica is slightly different than the first transom, but one would not know without seeing the original. Regardless of the differences, the current transom beautifully helps to complete the imagery of literally walking through the doors of another time. You can almost smell the books and hear the creaky floors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Stevens Point Carnegie Library is a more than a memory from the past, it was more than a building to many, it was an ideal, open to all, that brought a community together and gave its citizens a beautiful place to grow and learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Locals, today, fondly reminisce about the smell of ancient books, the sound of the creaking wood floors and the dark varnished wood.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Others do not remember the Carnegie Library, nor know it even existed at all.<\/p>\n<p><i>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

There was a preference to sell the old building and build a new modern library, but funding remained an issue.<\/p>\n<p>Then at the end of 1963, Charles M. White died and left $140,000 to the city. His intention was that it be used for a \u201cproject or building that will be beneficial\u201d to the people of Stevens Point. Almost immediately it was decided that money would go towards the building of a new modern public library leaving the fate of the Carnegie Library in the hands of whoever purchased the building and land.<\/p>\n<p>In April 1966, construction began on the new Charles M White library at the corner of Church and Clark Streets, a historic corner where the city\u2019s first church was built in 1853. It was also, ironically, next to the property where the high school burned in 1892, when the library lost half of its original collection.<\/p>\n<p>The new library would be built in the Brutalism style, a steep contrast to the Romanesque styling of its Carnegie Library sibling just down the road.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of December 1967, Stevens Point\u2019s Free Public Carnegie Library closed its heavy ornate doors and prepared for the move. Once again, the immense collection of books moved to a new home just down the block; and once again, they found a new home on new shelving, leaving the dusty, worn varnished shelves behind to meet their fate.<\/p>\n<p>The building was sold to the First National Bank and sat empty for a few years.

No records have been found that describe exactly how these books were moved, but one can imagine stacks carried piled to volunteers chins and carts piled high precariously pushed across the rough cobblestone street from one building to the next to finally put in order and shelved by Miss Catlin and Mrs. Dunegan themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The afternoon of June 1, the doors of Stevens Point\u2019s new Carnegie Library opened to the public for the first time. The words \u201cOpen To All\u201d etched in stone above the entrance greeted the city\u2019s new patrons encouraging all to enter and enjoy. The Union Band was set up in the lobby and an art exhibit of local children\u2019s drawings hung on display in the new children\u2019s reading room.\u00a0 Decorations were hung sparingly not to overshadow the real stars of the event, the building itself and the books on their new shelves.<\/p>\n<p>At completion the new library was just as architect drawings showed. The handsome Romanesque styled building constructed from gray stone and brick was built with a \u201chigh basement\u201d to match the height atheistic of the neighboring two-story buildings. The ample stone stairs led to the \u201cbroad and inviting\u201d entrance flanked with enormous ionic Greek pillars. Heavy wood doors opened to a wide vestibule with the \u201clibrarian\u2019s desk being at the north end of this space.\u201d To the left was a spacious reading room filled with tables and chairs, which housed reference books and the directors\u2019 room. Located in the right wing was the children\u2019s room as well as space for the librarian\u2019s office. The heavily varnished interior woodwork, made from red birch, gave off a warm inviting glow.<\/p>\n<p>A rotunda and dome graced the center of the ceiling and roof line of the building with a skylight made from green art glass specially shipped in by train. It must have been a lovely sight to see the light shine through leaving patterns on the polished wood floors. The original plan called for a narrow gallery around the rotunda, \u201cwhich is approached by a stairway from the vestibule. The walls of this gallery will be arranged with the idea of using the space for hanging pictures,\u201d making it an engaging focal point when looking to the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>The lower level contained \u201ca lecture hall, a club room for women and a newspaper reading room for men,\u201d as well as a kitchen, storeroom, boiler and fuel rooms, and a librarian\u2019s work room. At some point a billiards table was moved into the men\u2019s area where boys and men alike gathered to play. Various meetings were held by the ladies in their specified area as well. The Women\u2019s League was very involved in the fundraising for the library and held a permanent contract for their space. Separating the main lower wings of the building was a large open corridor with all three areas able to connect by opening the sliding doors create one large room. The large room was intended to be used for events and lectures for community members.<\/p>\n<p>Gifts from community members were given to the new building as well such as a large potted palm plant and a life-size bust of Shakespeare, donated by the graduating class of 1904.<\/p>\n<p>But one of the greatest and most beautiful gifts to the library was the donation of a pair of heavy decorative brass and iron doors, a matching iron transom for above the doors as well as a pair of tall ornate brass lamp posts in 1918. Purchased with money left by Andrew Weeks, the doors gave the library quite the grand entrance. Weeks, who had sat on the library board and building committee during the years when the library was being planned. He had also helped raise money for the library fund early on by selling logging land in the Northwoods and then donating it to the cause while the city was preparing to ask Carnegie for the initial donation.<\/p>\n<p>Coming from a successful lumber and logging family, Weeks died with a significant fortune and left for his time and left money specifically for the Stevens Point Carnegie Library. After his death, his sister ensured that the community received the designated $5,000 donation in her brother\u2019s name and helped choose the doors, transom, and lamps. The Weeks family obviously thought it was important that the Stevens Point Public Carnegie Library have a grand entrance.<\/p>\n<p><em>Continued next week<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

In a letter dated Jan. 11, 1904 Foeller tells Potter that he \u201cfind(s) it useless to urge you on since you seem to take your own time regardless of all notices.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It also seems that it was realized early on that the city would be short funds to reach completion, but work continued to move forward until the money was finally needed. Documents show that after balancing the budget for the building, including monies set aside for plumbing, heating, and the interior, that the city would need $1,858 more or the contractor would lose money. When the time came near completion, there was much discussion as to where to obtain the money. Eventually, the common council and the library board chose to ask Carnegie for more money:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd while the library spirit is excellent in Stevens Point, and our library circulation is larger than in any other city in Wisconsin of the population of Stevens Point, yet the people are poor, and the additional money, small as it may seem, is hard to get, almost impossible at this time,\u201d stated the library board and Stevens Point Common Council to Andrew Carnegie, March 1904.<\/p>\n<p>Fundraising continued in the form of a board of education vs. city council baseball game to pay for the cement walks and landscaping on the new grounds. Carnegie thankfully agreed to donate the additional funds, and completion pressed on. Opening day plans moved forward.<\/p>\n<p>Even with setbacks, two years to the month after Dr. Southwick received the letter from Carnegie\u2019s secretary, the library board declared the building finished enough for them to move in and hold meetings. Over the months of April and May, they raised the librarian\u2019s monthly salary from $25 to $45, hired an additional assistant librarian, hired a janitor with a $25 monthly wage, and set a reception and dedication date for June 1, 1904. In May, Henry Foeller made a last visit to inspect the building, and as architect he finalized the project, only commenting about the paint job on the outside metal pieces.<\/p>\n<p>And once again, the books were moved.<\/p>\n<p>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

Officially known as the city\u2019s first paid librarian, Miss Frances Catlin, called \u201cFanny,\u201d was paid $16 monthly to manage the library. When Fanny left the position in 1898, her sister Molly took her place, and Mrs. Mary Dunegan joined as assistant librarian.<\/p>\n<p>Catlin and Dunegan not only ran the small city library above Taylor\u2019s, but also traveled across Portage County to rural communities setting up \u201ctraveling libraries\u201d which consisted of small book collections. The pair placed the small collections of books in homes or businesses for a period, allowing locals to browse and borrow easily without having to come to Stevens Point to use the main library. Even with the traveling libraries and the new home above the drugstore, Stevens Point still had a great need for a dedicated free public library building.<\/p>\n<p>Libraries were not typically free to use anywhere in the United States, let alone the world, during the 19thand early 20thcentury. Many, such as the Stevens Point\u2019s library, had yearly or monthly fees \u2013 fees which some just could not afford.<\/p>\n<p>Philanthropist and steel mogul, Andrew Carnegie, believed in free self-education to a high enough degree that he made it a point to create a foundation. Starting in 1881, thousands of Carnegie Libraries were built across the United States. A community just need write and request the donation, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as it sounded. The people would have to come up with their own funding as well. Carnegie required that each city who received library funding guarantee an annual contribution of support consisting of 10 percent of the original donation before they would be considered.<\/p>\n<p>By January 1902 a few Stevens Point community members had written to Carnegie in hopes of being gifted the funds for a new library building. One of those people was the city physician, Dr. Frank Southwick. Civic-minded Southwick had come to Stevens Point from Maine in 1889 and was best known for helping to eradicate diphtheria among the city\u2019s children through immunization. He had managed to gain the attention of Carnegie when others had not, and he had managed to receive a reply stating that consideration would be given to the matter.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after, it was announced by local media that Carnegie wanted to know \u201chow much the city will guarantee\u201d in support of the library. Specifically, he wanted to know the amount of yearly taxes paid that went currently in support of the library and how much will be guaranteed annually, if the building is obtained. At the time, the city had $925 in the annual library tax fund and would need to raise $575 more yearly to support a request of $15,000 from Carnegie, an amount previously suggested.<\/p>\n<p>With a few local donations, some from members of the building committee, the library board and common council decided to ask for larger sum. At the end of April 1902, Southwick received a letter written by Andrew Carnegie\u2019s secretary letting him know that Mr. Carnegie would be donating $20,000 \u2013 approximately $613,000 today \u2013 towards the completion of a free public library building in Stevens Point.<\/p>\n<p><em>Continued next week<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

Few remain in use as libraries today, but many have been preserved as museums or historical society headquarters. Sadly at least 14 have been razed.<\/p>\n<p>Locals may not realize that Stevens Point once had its own Carnegie library downtown since the land is now a blacktopped commercial driveway and nothing remains to signify it ever existed. As with several other of Stevens Point\u2019s prominent historic buildings, the public library met the fate of the wrecking ball over 50 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The history of the public library in Stevens Point reaches as far back as 1853 when the editor of the only newspaper in town at the time, The Wisconsin Pineries, made a call for a lending library on the paper\u2019s front page. By the late 1860s a Library Association, founded from early reading circles, began to hold dances, dinners, and bake sales to fund the city\u2019s growing need for reading materials. One of the earliest public lending libraries was kept inside the White School which was located on the corner of Arlington Place and Water Street, where the Lincoln Center stands today.<\/p>\n<p>In 1874, the association had raised enough money to rent a room above HD McCulloch\u2019s Drug Store on the corner of Main and Third Streets. This was the first set of rooms devoted solely to the purpose of a public lending library furnished with proper shelving and space for patrons to sit and enjoy the books they could borrow.<\/p>\n<p>However, book borrowing came at a cost. Only those that could afford the $3 yearly fee could enjoy borrowing privileges. With an average yearly income of around $400 for laborers in the lumber and paper industries in Wisconsin, library membership might not have been a priority, but the need was certainly still there. Later, in 1885, after a free library reading room was set up in a local ice cream shop, the Library Association dropped the fee to a more reasonable $1 a year, which would equal in value to $30.64 today.<\/p>\n<p>As the library collection grew and reading popularity continued, space became limited and the books were moved to the high school building on corner of Clark and Church Street in 1887. Tragically half of the collection was destroyed when the building caught fire on a cold night in February 1892. The remainder were salvaged and stored for a bit, before finding new shelves.<\/p>\n<p><em>Continued next week<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

An incredibly modern building, the new facility was welcomed by the city. The vocational school moved to the new building and vacated the ailing 19th century property slated for demolition.<\/p>\n<p>By 1962 fresh dirt covered the ground where the original imposing red brick Queen Anne structure once stood. No sign was left of the decrepit 40-year-old temporary barracks. Some of the space was paved over for parking and on the Reserve Street side of the property and playground equipment was eventually installed.<\/p>\n<p>During the 1960s, the Annex continued to be used by the junior high. As Stevens Point\u2019s population continued to increase, classroom space was again needed. Benjamin Franklin Junior High opened the fall of 1968, and later, in 1970, a new up to date three-year high school opened, today\u2019s Stevens Point Area Senior High. That same year Emerson\u2019s seventh and eighth grades moved to the PJ Jacobs building to join the freshmen, and Emerson began life as an elementary school for grades three through six, with the younger students attending nearby Jefferson Elementary.<\/p>\n<p>In 1982 the property changed hands from the city of Stevens Point to the newly independent Stevens Point School District and usage shifted. The building sat vacant for a bit. It was later used by Jefferson Elementary students while an expansion was added to their school.<\/p>\n<p>Various extracurricular activities were held at the building over this time, such as: aerobics classes, wresting practice, and tap dance lessons.<\/p>\n<p>Emerson hosted its final students over the course of the last decade in the 20th century. During 1991- 2001 it was used for the growing SPASH Alternative Programs which had moved from the old Grant Elementary School to another building slated for the wrecking ball. Parts of the Emerson facility were off limits during that time due to safety concerns. The aging building was nearing its end.<\/p>\n<p>The final 79-year-old brick structure was demolished in 2002. Long gone were the days of cramped classrooms, the barracks, and basketball at the Parish House and Normal School. \u201cThe large smoke stack [sic]\u2026tumbled with one hit to the center by a massive crane\u2026\u201d and thus ended the 109-year era of public school buildings on the property.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of a century, the Emerson property served the area\u2019s students well. It is only right that after nearly 20 years of vacancy that the land continues to serve the children of the city in one of the best ways known, as a public park with space to grow and be free.<\/p>\n<p>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

Bids for construction opened in April 1922.<\/p>\n<p>Designed by Milwaukee architects Robert Messmer and Brother, the new high school unit was to be built on the East Avenue side of the property. The modern building would include a large gymnasium and spacious auditorium that could seat up to 1,500. Ironically, much like its predecessor, completion of the building was held up in when a train carload of bricks was lost in transit forcing the school board to abandon hope of having the building ready for spring semester. But as completion neared in June of 1923, the first event was held in the new auditorium, a popular operetta of the time, \u201cIn Old Louisiana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new unit, colloquially referred to as \u201cThe Annex,\u201d connected to the old building through a short corridor. During construction the temporary building was moved to the Reserve Street side of the property and connected to the original school through a longer corridor. Sources mention the barracks being used as a construction office, but newspaper accounts explain it was brought in as additional classroom space before construction began. All three buildings together were referred to as Emerson School.<\/p>\n<p>Overcrowding in the school continued as Stevens Point\u2019s population swelled. Almost 800 students attended the city\u2019s high school in 1929. Quite a bit more than the 277 when the original facility had opened in 1893. With WPA funding, PJ Jacobs High School opened its doors to students in 1938. After construction, it was decided that the new building would be used as a four-year school, instead of the three-year school as originally intended. Lockers had to be moved from the Emerson building to the basement of PJ Jacobs to accommodate the freshmen moving to the new school along with the rest of the upper classes.<\/p>\n<p>That fall, the Emerson Annex began to be used solely as a junior high for seventh and eighth grades housing up to about 250 students. Following earlier plans, about 100 students from the vocational school moved into the original 1893 structure. Equipment was moved from the downtown location and a welding unit was set up in the basement. At some point, the city\u2019s special education classes began to be held on the third floor. Technical education classes for high school students remained on the property as well. The barracks building was used for printing and metal sheeting classes.<\/p>\n<p>Safety concerns were brought up the winter of 1953. A group of concerned citizens criticized the outdated original building and the aging temporary barracks. Complaints were made about the restroom facilities, open wiring on wood walls, crumbling brick, dangerous fire escapes, and the leaking roof. The interior of the building was wood and the exterior brick with few fire-safety precautions. One of the biggest hazards mentioned regarded the welding department in the basement with the third floor being used for the special education department. The group lamented that the situation was a disaster waiting to happen. Reminders of previous school fires were mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>Discussions began in relation to moving the vocational school, tearing down the old buildings, and leaving the Annex to be used as a junior high. Talks went on for years of how to handle the vocational school situation. During this time the original school structure and barracks remained in use. Eventually it was decided to build a new vocational school. When it was completed, the brick 1893 building and the 40-year-old temporary structure would be demolished.<\/p>\n<p>Continued next week<\/p>\n<p>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

In 1901, it was reported that the seniors were wearing lapel pins with a fleur de lis and the initials EHS. A few years later the boys\u2019 football and basketball teams were given 10-inch crimson and black circle emblems with the letters EHS to sew on their sweaters. Still the school was called the Stevens Point High School by most.<\/p>\n<p>There was later discussion regarding whether to put the name Emerson High School on the new diplomas that needed to be ordered for the graduating class of 1912. It likely did not happen, however, because it wasn\u2019t until 1929 that the name Emerson High School officially appeared on the yearbooks.<\/p>\n<p>The brick building suited Stevens Point for about two decades though it was lacking from the start. The third-floor gymnasium was small and quickly consumed by classrooms. Basketball games were played at Parish Hall or the Normal School. The old school also lacked proper restroom facilities for the ever-growing student body. With the toilets located in the basement and then just one on the third floor, the school needed modernization. But what the city really needed was a new facility. Talks began in the fall of 1919 regarding what to do about a new high school building as enrollment reached 370, up 55 students from the previous year.<\/p>\n<p>As discussions for a new high school building began, plans were in works to move the vocational school from its downtown location on the second floor of the old Worzella Publishing building to the original high school building. With the new unit housing the majority of the high school students, the old 1893 building would mostly be used for \u201chome economics, manual training, and science work,\u201d leaving plenty of room for vocational school use. There was question if there would be room enough for the girls\u2019 vocational classes, but it was decided the issue would be resolved if needed by using the commercial department\u2019s off campus Main Street facility if needed. The vocational school remained downtown until 1938.<\/p>\n<p>Students complained about crowded classrooms and folding chairs stacked in the halls of the main building. Congestion in the building was so significant that a temporary structure was built behind the main building on the Ellis Street side. The original \u201cbarracks\u201d structure was used for the first time in October of 1921, adding four classrooms for the growing student body. That same month the common council voted unanimously to build a new high school. However, the \u201ctemporary\u201d building would remain in use for another 40 years.<\/p>\n<p><em>Continued next week<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

So he bundled them up and dropped them off for distribution.<\/p>\n<p>Among the papers were three letters to Katherine Engel of Stockbridge, my wife Nancy\u2019s grandmother, about her son, Claude W. Engel, who served in the U.S. Army.<\/p>\n<p>The first was a letter from the War Department informing Nancy\u2019s grandmother that her son was killed in action on Sept. 16, 1944, in Germany.<\/p>\n<p>The letter, signed by Major General J.A. Ulio, The Adjutant General, said \u201cI fully understand your desire to learn as much as possible regarding the circumstances leading to his death, and I wish that there were more information available to give you. Unfortunately, reports of this nature contain only the briefest details as they are prepared under battle conditions and the means of transmission are limited.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Katherine wasn\u2019t satisfied by the Army\u2019s response. She wanted to know how her son had died and instituted efforts to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Her efforts prompted the other two letters, handwritten by a Loren Wilson of Lincoln, Neb., who served in the same unit in the U.S. Army with Claude. The letters were both written in response to inquiries for information by Katherine in 1947.<\/p>\n<p>The first letter was postmarked May 14, 1947, and Wilson said he was reading the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) national paper when he saw her notice about her son Claude. His letter was short, only 113 words long, and asked the mother if she really wanted to learn about his death.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cClaude was my squad leader when we left the states, and I was with him all the way through,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cYou can well be proud of Claude (and I speak for the whole company), everyone of us thought a great deal of him, and his death was a great loss to our outfit. I\u2019m not going to tell you about his death now, but if you wish to hear about it, let me know as I was with him at the time. I only hope I could meet you personally as Claude was my real friend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Katherine apparently responded promptly to Wilson because Wilson apologized in a letter dated June 10, 1947, for not responding sooner because he had just lost his father who lived in Minnesota.<\/p>\n<h4>60th Infantry Regiment<\/h4>\n<p>Wilson wrote that he joined Claude\u2019s squad in the 60th Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg, N.C., and four days later they went to Norfolk, Va., for amphibious training. The unit boarded ships to cross the Atlantic Ocean before landing at Port Lyautey in French Morocco, about 100 miles north of Casablanca, to spearhead the November 1942 Operation Torch invasion.<\/p>\n<p>They then moved about 800 miles to Tunisia and fought until the end of the campaign that ended at Bizerte, Algeria, he wrote.<\/p>\n<p>The unit stayed in North Africa until the end of July 1943, and landed on Aug. 5, 1943, at Palermo, Sicily, he wrote, fighting in the mountains and ending up at Mount Etna before being sent to the seaside to rest and await new orders.<\/p>\n<p>Wilson wrote that the soldiers did \u201clots of swimming and had a pretty good time until one day in November, when we got word to move again. There were lots of rumors as to where we were going, but it ended up to be England.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After living in those other countries, he wrote, \u201cEngland seemed like home, anyway they spoke the same language, it wasn\u2019t all fun there, we got lots of training, and, of course, we know what that was for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The unit stayed in Winchester, about seventy miles south of London. Wilson said the English treated the troops \u201cvery nicely\u201d and the unit remained there until shortly before the D-Day invasion when they moved to the coastal area.<\/p>\n<p>The 60th Infantry didn\u2019t go to France until four days after the actual invasion, although the beach was still being shelled when its soldiers went in at Utah Beach, Wilson wrote. The unit moved inland and \u201chad it pretty rough through the hedgerows of Normandy,\u201d playing \u201ca big part in the capture of Cherbourg and then came the battle for St. Lo,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe lost a lot of men in Normandy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Casualty in Germany<\/h4>\n<p>After the breakout at St. Lo, the 60th made a \u201cwild\u201d dash across France and Belgium, he wrote, and didn\u2019t meet much of the enemy until it crossed the German border on Sept. 15, 1944. The first town in Germany the unit reached was Monchau, he wrote, and it was just outside of this town where Claude was killed the following day, on Sept. 16.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were in a real small town by the name of Hoffen, and it was about midnite (sic) when the Germans broke through our lines with tanks so it was our job to try and stop them, which we did but lost some very good men. I don\u2019t believe Claude knew what happened. I know he didn\u2019t suffer. I hope I have given you an idea as to where Claude went on his travels. I hope I didn\u2019t forget any place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Claude was buried at Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery in Henri-Chapelle, Belgium, a small town northwest of Cologne, Germany. Nancy and I visited his grave in 1974 on our honeymoon, a side trip that left us with many vivid memories.<\/p>\n<p>Another item delivered to us was the box containing Claude\u2019s Purple Heart, his World War II military ID bracelet, his Technician 4th Grade shoulder patch, his mother\u2019s Gold Star Mother pin and other pins and medals.<\/p>\n<p>Using ancestry.com and Google, I was able to track Wilson, the man who provided Claude\u2019s mother and family with the information about his years in the Army. Wilson died June 6, 2011, at age 98 in Blackberry, Minn. His online obituary from the June 11, 2011, Grand Rapids, Minn., Herald Review said he moved back to Minnesota after the war.<\/p>\n<p>The obituary also said \u201cHe loved his home in the country and spending time with his many friends meant so much to him.\u201d The time he spent responding to Katherine Engel\u2019s letters has also brought countless joy to the family of Claude Engel.<\/p>\n<p>Without his kindness, the family wouldn\u2019t have known what happened to him. Unfortunately, too many other families of war veterans never learn what happened to their loved ones.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Correspondence to a WWII soldier\u2019s mother<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":113002,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[2459],"tags":[544],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

An exciting new life waits for the land. The property has a long history beyond the large 1920s red brick structure and smokestack with which many of us are familiar.<\/p>\n<p>At one time three very different structures stood on the land. The Emerson property history begins downtown where a parking lot stands today.<\/p>\n<p>Stevens Point\u2019s first brick upper class school building was built in 1876. Located on Clark Street just down from Church Street, it was destroyed by fire in February of 1892. To the students\u2019 dismay, it had been worked out promptly that school would continue without interruption.<\/p>\n<p>For now, high school students would gather at Guild Hall; A Grammar, the seventh graders, at the new third ward school; and B Grammar, the eighth graders, on the south side at Redfield\u2019s Store on Church Street. It had also been quickly decided that the school would need to be rebuilt and that new high school was needed immediately.<\/p>\n<p>The new high school would be built down the road and a new grammar school on the site of the burned-out school. Bids for construction of the high school facility were requested starting as soon as December of 1892. The contract was awarded to MT Olin who began work right away.<\/p>\n<p>By mid-1893 the building was well on its way to completion. The new two-story building with an attic third floor and sloping roof lines was described as \u201cvery neat, substantial\u2026with trimmings of stone and terra cotta.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The third-floor attic space was intended to be used as a gymnasium. Seventh and eighth grade would be located on the first floor, along with Superintendent Snyder\u2019s office, while the second story would be used solely by the upper classes.<\/p>\n<p>In less than 18 months, the new high school structure was completed on vacant land between Clark and Ellis Street, bordered by East Avenue and Reserve Street.<\/p>\n<p>An enormous imposing Victorian Queen Anne style structure, the new red brick building boasted a large circular tower with peaked roofs and state of the art plumbing. The building was furnished in part by 287 student desks and nine teachers\u2019 desks purchased at the cost of $900. The facility in its entirety was valued at $35,000, equivalent to approximately $1,000,880 in today\u2019s money.<\/p>\n<p>Even though completion was held up momentarily \u201cbecause circular bricks for the tower could not be obtained as soon as wanted,\u201d the building doors were \u201cthrown open\u201d to 277 students from six different grades September 11, 1893, just 10 days late of the original plan.<\/p>\n<p>Continued next week<\/p>\n<p>This story is being used courtesy of Chelsey Pfiffner, research historian and proprietor of Primary Source Investigations.

The foundation of our country has regarded Native Americans as sub-human. So, when I say that I am not surprised, I mean that I am not surprised.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe UW-Stevens Point administration taking this step of acknowledging that the foundation of our institution is built on a burial site is only one step in the right direction. It is my hope that this valued step propels every university department to further their commitment to Native American students and all students who have been historically marginalized.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn aboriginal leader from Canada once said, \u2018Where common memory is lacking; where people do not share in the same past, there can be no real community. Where community is to be formed, common memory must be created.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUWSP is on the cusp of creating common memory with the sovereign nations it is surrounded by in this great state of Wisconsin. Identifying and acknowledging the harmful history we all share is important in forming and nurturing this new community. This is where the work begins. It cannot end at this acknowledgement. Formal relationships must be established among our university leadership with each tribal government.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_112863\" style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112863\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-112863\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Native American Marker Brooks Boyd\" width=\"435\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/FP-Native-American-Marker-2-201225.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-112863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brooks Boyd, Forest County Potawatomi Executive Council member, expressed the importance of getting those tribes tied to the burial grounds involved. Kris Leonhardt photo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>UWSP Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Al Thompson said that the university was taking a first step to building that commonality.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it is important to recognize that we have come a long way; that we have reached a moment of a new chapter with our Native friends and families. Building a relationship that is not just this marker behind us, but that we are going to go further; and, to go further means deeper discussions on how we build long-lasting relationships on this beautiful campus that is now being recognized as a place where folks before, many years ago, were left behind,\u201d Thompson said.<\/p>\n<p>Brooks Boyd, Forest County Potawatomi Executive Council member, expressed the importance of getting those tribes tied to the burial grounds involved.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all know this is very important. If we want to have something done the correct way, we have to have the right people at the table that know best about this,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a very big deal. This is something that is long overdue, and I know that these spirits are feeling good about that. I know that they are here and that there are a lot of good feelings here. They know that everybody that is involved has a big purpose, has a big part in making this happen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>David Grignon, of the Menominee Historic Preservation Department and state of Wisconsin Burial Site Preservation Board, expressed the commonality, not just regarding the land, but today\u2019s environment, as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThose burials, they said there were three maybe four tribes, but this area is ancestral territory of the Menominee people,\u201d Grignon said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow these people died; how our ancestors died is something we are living through now. Scarlet Fever, they died from that. I just couldn\u2019t imagine; they just buried them in a common grave. They didn\u2019t have the ceremonies that are supposed to go along with that traditionally, when our people die. A four-day ceremony, I don\u2019t think they had that ceremony. I don\u2019t think they had the send-off prayers that go with that; I don\u2019t think they had the feasts that go with that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe burial ground itself was desecrated by having a garbage dump, garbage threw on them. That is a horrific thing to do to a burial.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that this information came forward at this time that our people are here. At some point, I hope that the community does a ghost supper for them\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The university\u2019s new School of Humanities and Global Studies is working with tribes, as well as university staff and students, to install a permanent exhibit in UW-Stevens Point\u2019s Museum of Natural History, tentatively scheduled to open in 2023.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 A temporary memorial marker was placed on the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point campus, just south of the Dreyfus Center, to recognize the Native American individuals buried there in the late 1800s.

I think the film does a good job of showing what the commitment to the military\/country means and the toll it can take on the soldiers whether in 1919 or 2020. As an example the end of the film deals with what today we call PTSD, then it was called shell shock,\u201d said PCHS President Tim Siebert.<\/p>\n<p>The video was part of the \u201cOver There &#8211; Portage County in the Great War\u201d program, which recently received the 2019 Public Program Award from the Wisconsin Historical Society.<\/p>\n<p>The award recognizes \u201coutstanding work in a new Wisconsin public history program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The retrospective on \u201cThe Great War\u201d consisted of seven months of events and programs that evolved from a range of partnerships and included exhibits, published books, speakers, and a park dedication.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Public Programs award is one of several award categories that the state historical society presents each year. They include a publications award, museum displays award, Thwaites Award for overall programming and can only be won every 20 years; we received it 19 years ago,\u201d explained Siebert.<\/p>\n<p>Siebert said that the award reflected the contributions of local volunteers and those who served from Portage County.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, it reflects the many hours of work that a number of people put in, particularly Sue Koehl, Sara Scripps, Anton Anday, and Tim Siebert. Thanks to their efforts the society was able to engage the help of a variety of organizations and schools in the area to make the whole Great War Remembrance presentations very much a county wide effort,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSecondly, I think, the award helps to recognize the contribution that the people of this county contributed to the war effort.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFinally, the award is the recognition of the wide variety of presentations the historical society put together as a remembrance of the county\u2019s contribution to the war effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cOver There &#8211; Portage County in the Great War\u201d video is available by contacting PCHS at P.O.

transportation in 1912, few all weather roads existed in the northern portion of our young country.<\/p>\n<p>As automobiles slowly made their way into the country, a need for a road system soon followed.<\/p>\n<p>In 1895, there were only a couple of hundred cars in the United States, but by the end of 1900, there were thousands and car manufactures, Ford, GM, and Chrysler were building more each day as car manufacturing hit its stride in America.<\/p>\n<p>As the allure of autonomy drew Americans toward car ownership, auto clubs began to form.<\/p>\n<p>But drivers yearned for quality driving routes, free of sand, mud, and potholes.<\/p>\n<p>In the early days of automobile transportation, financing of roads was left to the local landowners and townships.<\/p>\n<p><div

Kris Leonhardt<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>An idea conceived by Joseph William Parmley would changed all of that, placing the responsibility in the hands of entire communities and those that would benefit from the traffic passing through the region.<\/p>\n<p>In April 1912, Parmley and business colleagues pioneered 25 miles of quality roadway between Ipswitch to Aberdeen, South Dakota. That was later expanded to provide tourists with access to Yellowstone National Park.<\/p>\n<p>That move would spurn the creation of the first transcontinental auto route in the northern portion of the country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From Plymouth Rock to Puget Sound<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In October 1912, the Yellowstone Trail Association was formed to help build an auto route from \u201cPlymouth Rock to Puget Sound.\u201d The grassroots effort was designed to lobby for good roads and promote cross country tourism, by developing local and state association chapters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Yellowstone Trail is not merely an organized highway. It is preeminently the organized highway of all the world,\u201d said Yellowstone Association General Manager H.O. Cooley in a <em>Kenosha News<\/em> article. \u201cThe Yellowstone Trail Association is merely the name of a partnership by which towns and communities along its route clear across the country may work for their mutual advantage in all things which encourage travel by automobile for long distances to their particular communities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Headquartered in Minneapolis, promoters and representatives crisscrossed the Midwest enacting communities to join the cause along a route selected, due to road quality and access to amenities.<\/p>\n<p>Association representative, O.T. Peterson told local government administration and local merchant and manufacturer representatives at a May 1915 meeting, \u201cthe northern Wisconsin route from Minneapolis to Chicago had been selected on the advice of Minneapolis and St. Paul people, and against the sentiments of Chicago and Milwaukee people, who preferred the Madison-La Cross route.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The northern route, however, was shorter by some 30 miles.<\/p>\n<p>The northern route also offered \u201ceverything the tourist desires in the way of scenery in summer. It has cool nights, good hotels and supply stations, and is without long jumps between cities where water, gasoline, food, and lodging can be secured,\u201d Peterson added, as chronicled in<em> The Oshkosh Northwestern<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building the trail through central Wisconsin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As Marshfield representatives celebrated \u201cTrail Day\u201d on June 7, 1915, representatives from Grand Rapids \u2013 now Wisconsin Rapids \u2013 were fighting for a route change. Rapids was asking for the trail to be rerouted to their city and then onto Waupaca, bypassing Stevens Point and Amherst. Grand Rapids representatives argued that the trunk line road between Marshfield and Rapids was \u201cfully graded\u201d and already improved upon.

George Stevens was on his way to the Wausau area, where he planned to build a sawmill along the Wisconsin River because reports indicated the area to the north was teeming with tall white pines trees.<\/p>\n<p>On his way north in 1839, he stopped at a point formed where Moses Creek flowed into the Wisconsin and purchased a small shanty. He then constructed an addition to hold supplies because he planned to use the point as a rest stop and resupply area on the journey north to Wausau.<\/p>\n<p>Because he owned that cabin on the point, other lumbermen heading north called the place Stevens\u2019 Point or Stevens\u2019 Landing, and settlers adopted that name for the community that sprang up there.<\/p>\n<p>In 1845 Matthias Mitchell purchased land in what was to become downtown Stevens Point and in 1847 he platted the property to include the Public Square and four surrounding streets, Main, Clark(e), First and Second.<\/p>\n<p>While three of those streets are common names in many cities, Clarke Street may have been named for William H. Clarke who was a justice of the peace in the community. The \u201ce\u201d at the end of the name was subsequently dropped.<\/p>\n<p>Many streets bear the names of the developers and their families, a practice that increased as time went on, as well as some historic locations.<\/p>\n<p>Moses Strong, a pioneer, platted the first subdivision adjacent to Mitchell\u2019s land, extending from present day Portage Street south to Shaurette Street between the Wisconsin River and Division Street.<\/p>\n<p>He named the east-west streets Bray Street (the west end of Portage Street); Brown Street after Edward Dexter Brown, a lumberman (that street is now College Avenue); Crooked Way, a shortcut from Clark Street to Strongs Avenue that is now Ellis Street; Mill Street because it led to the first sawmill; Brawley Street after Abraham Brawley, a lumberman; Wisconsin Street; and Shaurette Street after the Shaurette family, early settlers whose name was also bestowed on area rapids in the Wisconsin River. Mill Street was later named Arlington Place because a major hotel, Arlington House, was located there.<\/p>\n<p>The north-south streets included Water Street; Strongs Avenue, after Strong himself; Church Street after the Episcopal Church that was the first church in Stevens Point; Spruce Street; Pine Street; Plover Street after the Plover River; Elk Street; Prairie Street; and Wood Street, located near a wooded area.<\/p>\n<p>In 1853, a plat added Smith Street after Milo Smith, Briggs Street after Orin Briggs, Phillips Street after John C. Phillips; and Prentice Street after Jackson L. Prentice, the first county surveyor. Smith, Briggs and Phillips were pioneers and the developers of the subdivision.<\/p>\n<p>Nathaniel F. Bliss, another pioneer and the husband of Stevens Point\u2019s first school teacher, added a subdivision in 1871, naming Bliss Avenue for his family; Mason Street possibly after Charles E. Mason, an early clerk of court; and Brewery Street (now the eastern two blocks of Francis Street) because the Stevens Point brewery was located there.<\/p>\n<p>Walker Street was named for John A. Walker, a lumberman; Wadleigh Street for Matthew Wadleigh, a lumberman; West Whitney Street for Ebenezer Whitney, a lumberman; Quarry Street for a quarry located there that furnished the stones for the first courthouse; Boyington Avenue for Nathaniel Boyington, a lumberman; Atwell Street for V.P. Atwell, a pioneer; Whiting Avenue for George A. Whiting, a paper mill pioneer; Patch Street for Rev. Jacob Patch who lived there; Warner Street for Horace O. Warner, a pioneer; Chase Street for Homer Chase, a river pilot; and Cross Street for William Cross, a pioneer.<\/p>\n<p>Rice Street was named for James and John Rice, foundry operators; Prais Street for Victor S. Prais, a local businessman; Bukolt Avenue for John J. Bukolt, founder of Lullabye Furniture; Isadore Street for John Isadore, a land owner; Gilkay Street for John Gilkay; Koch Street for William Koch, a blind guitar player who played for area dances; Heffron Street for John J. Heffron, a real estate broker; Delaney Street for William Delaney, a Greek barber; West Karner Street after the family that owned a west side sawmill; and West Scott Street after Ed Scott who lived on the street.<\/p>\n<p>Public officials have streets named for them, Wyatt Avenue for A.F. Wyatt, a longtime register of deeds; Rogers Street after George L. Rogers, a one-time mayor; Lee Street for Leo Mancheski, a longtime Stevens Point alderperson; Welsby Avenue for John N. \u201cSpot\u201d Welsby, then the longest-serving mayor; Clayton Street for Godfrey F. Clayton, a former mayor; Simonis Street for Nick Simonis of Rosholt; Peck Street after Joseph A. Peck, a city assessor; Sims Avenue for John F. Sims, president of Stevens Point Normal School; and Nebel Street for C.E. Nebel, a County Board supervisor.<\/p>\n<p>Relatives of pioneer families and the developers of the area also had streets named for them, George Street (now Georgia Street) for George H. Patch; Frederick Street for Frederick Patch; Forest Street for Forest Grant; Crosby Avenue for Crosby Grant; Julia Street for Julia Vaughn, the wife of Eliplet Vaughn, the parcel\u2019s developer; Lora Street for Lora Wadleigh; the wife of Matthew Wadleigh; Mary Street for Dr. Mary Helen Patch; and Martha\u2019s Lane for Martha Ann Patch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter Stevens Point\u2019s street names provide a glimpse into a city\u2019s history, with many of them bearing the names of the city\u2019s pioneers, their families and locations.

Under the leadership of founders John and Charles Wesley, it grew to become one of the largest Protestant denominations in the country.<\/p>\n<p>As the religion began to grow in America, pastors began traveling through districts to serve multiple congregations.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, one minister served the communities of Keene, a community started with a sawmill and a foundry along the Buena Vista Creek; Buena Vista, a community which was located 700 feet east of Keene; Calkins; Neuman; and Plover.<\/p>\n<p>Services began in family homes and schoolhouses, and other municipal facilities.<\/p>\n<p>In 1861, the Plover Methodist congregation built its first church on the north side of the Green Bay &amp; Western Railroad tracks, north of the present day Heritage Park site. The Presbyterian Church had built a church a half block south of the Methodist church, as settlers began arriving in the area.<\/p>\n<p>An October 1895 Gazette article shows the shifting landscape, as new residents came to Portage County and more ministers were assigned to lead them. It reads, \u201cRev. C.W. Turner will again look after the spiritual wants of his congregation at Amherst, and Rev. W.G. Cooper will have charge of the Buena Vista and Newman churches. No appointment was made for the Plover and Calkins houses of worship, the places to be supplied.\u00a0 Rev. L.B. Bullock, late pastor of the Methodist churches at Plover and Almond, has been put on the superannuated or retired list and Rev. T.C. Rochelle will look after the Almond charge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One parishioner recalls the choir room in the old church being used as a kitchen, with meals served in the vestibule. Meals were later served in the old town hall.<\/p>\n<p>As the nearby Presbyterian congregation diminished, the first Methodist Church was moved south and east of Plover to become the Calkins Church and later torn down in the early 1900s.<\/p>\n<p>The Methodist congregation then purchased the Presbyterian Church and began services there.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 1930s, the church underwent a major remodeling. The basement and kitchen was enlarged and running water was added, to serve the congregation as a parish hall. There they hosted funeral meals and \u201c10 cent suppers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The idea of the 10 cent supper came during the Great Depression. The economic downturn made jobs and money scarce. The church\u2019s Lady\u2019s Aid group created the 10 cent supper to help provide for the congregation\u2019s families.<\/p>\n<p>In a potluck style, families were asked to bring a dish and pay 10 cents to enjoy the full meal.<\/p>\n<p>In 1943, the church celebrated their 100th anniversary, recounting the first service which was held the summer of 1843, led by Reverend J. Hurbert, who came from the southern part of the state to lead them.<\/p>\n<p>Continued in the next edition<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt PLOVER &#8212; The Methodist Episcopal Church is often credited as the first Methodist denomination to form in the United States of America.

The reason the Polish government paid for it, they wanted to train the future leaders of Poland. The Polish government, and the Polish people, hoped to return to Poland. They didn\u2019t think that communism in Poland would last.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the school, Gena was taught four different languages at the same time \u2013 Polish, English, Latin, and Greek.\u00a0\u00a0She was also taught United States history, England\u2019s history, and Polish history; and geography.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFrom what I could tell, (the education) was weak in two areas \u2013 one was a science, because they were limited in equipment for science lab; and music, as the only instrument available was on piano,\u201d Gene said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The school was 15-20 miles from the Fairford camp, where Gena\u2019s family lived in \u201cNissen huts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere was a British officer in World War I who invented a way to erect buildings quickly and this was continued during World War II,\u201d Gene explained. \u201cIn this country, we call them quonset huts, but (the Nissen hut) is the same structure.

Bed bugs were a problem for the families and moss was used to fill in the spaces between the logs to help block the draft.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey were cutting down trees, hauling them to the riverbank, and then in the spring the logs would be released and float down the river, just like it was done in Wisconsin over 100 years ago,\u201d Numsen explained.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gena started the first grade while living in Russia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If family members worked they were given an allotment of bread and children were given half of that, supplementing their diet with mushrooms and berries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA few foresighted people brought potatoes with them to plant,\u201d Numsen added. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time that Russians took Poles into captivity. There were a number of times in the 19<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0Century.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Gena\u2019s time in captivity, she suffered some frostbite in the toes and fingers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was cold. It was one of the coldest winters on record,\u201d Numsen said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat she remembered though is having a dream at night. Her mother had baked some bread. She could smell it, it was still warm, and she broke off a piece and put it into her mouth. At that instance, she awakened.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cShe remembered being hungry more than being cold.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Next week: Getting out<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt Senior Editor Continued from previous edition.
