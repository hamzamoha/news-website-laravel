Mack just happened to be off that day from his job as a firefighter\/paramedic with the Stevens Point Fire Department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe was sitting in his living room just looking out at the street,\u201d Gotta told us. \u201cHe saw his neighbor outside and then he saw me laying on the ground. He came outside immediately, performed CPR, called 911 and the ambulance and got me up to Wausau and here I am now. If I wouldn\u2019t have went down in front of an EMT, who knows what would\u2019ve happened?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotta, who until this point had no history of any medical issues, had just suffered from cardiac sarcoidosis, a rare auto-immune disease in which tiny immune cells, or granulomas, collect in the heart tissue, interfering with normal function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like 30 out of a hundred thousand people get it,\u201d Gotta told us. \u201cThe cardiology people told us that they have no way of detecting this disease. They have no way of knowing who has it or who might get it, but they know how to treat it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can suspect it by the patient\u2019s symptoms,\u201d says Dr. German Larrain, Medical Director for Aspirus Heart, Wausau. \u201cAnd you can detect it with a chest x-ray or a CT scan or an MRI, so if you suspect it you can image it and see what the extent of it is.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know really what triggers it,\u201d Dr. Larrain added. \u201cIt comes at any time. It\u2019s not like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re smoking. You\u2019re going to get heart disease.\u2019 Sarcoidosis is not like that. It\u2019ll hit anybody. You don\u2019t know who it\u2019s gonna hit and we don\u2019t really know what triggers it.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can be the lymph nodes, the skin, it can go to the eye, to the liver, to the heart, to the spleen, so pretty much any organ can be affected,\u201d Larrain tells us. \u201cBut lungs is by far the most frequent, and then skin and lymph nodes.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen it affects the heart it\u2019s particularly serious because you can get an irregular heartbeat, and that could be malignant, so you could have a cardiac arrest,\u201d Dr. Larrain adds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in pretty good shape. I usually walk every day, at least an hour at a time when I walk,\u201d says Gotta, who also served as a WIAA high school football and basketball official for 46 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen they said he had a heart attack, I thought, \u2018Mark walks every day. He can\u2019t have a heart attack. He\u2019s healthy.\u2019 I was pretty much in shock,\u201d added Mark\u2019s wife Joanne.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWords can\u2019t even express our gratitude towards him,\u201d Gotta said of Mack. \u201cHe saved my life and that\u2019s what I told him.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotta and his family visited Mack at the fire station Nov. 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe wanted to shake my hand and I couldn\u2019t shake his hand. I had to give him a hug,\u201d Gotta added. \u201cIt just seemed like shaking hands and saying \u2018Thank you\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Mack told the Gotta family he was just doing his job. And then, just like that, he was off doing it some more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were there about ten minutes and we were talking, and all of a sudden another call came in and he had to go on another call,\u201d Gotta recalled. \u201cThese guys are unbelievable, and I think just for our community they should know how lucky we are to have the people we have in these positions and our fire stations, all the EMTs and paramedics. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more incredible about Gotta\u2019s episode is that it happened on a particularly busy day for the Stevens Point Fire Department, so Mack \u2013 after having administered CPR \u2013 drove Gotta to Aspirus Wausau Hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d said Gotta. \u201cHe went above and beyond duty.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gotta family wanted to do something for Mack, but that kind of gesture is against department protocol. After all, they will tell you they\u2019re just doing their jobs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BY MIKE WARREN EDITOR STEVENS POINT \u2013 Just 15 days before his 70th birthday, and 49 days before Christmas, Mark Gotta received the gift of a lifetime \u2013 quite literally. \u201cI was out walking, and I had to pick up my\u2026 one of my cars was getting some service done, so I was walking from my house to about six to eight blocks away,\u201d Gotta told the Gazette, as he recalled the events of Nov. 6. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything after that.

That\u2019s the first stage in any process. As we were finishing up that process, some things I think felt by the Space and Properties Committee changed in the process and changed in the financial outlook of the health care center and the referendum dollars, so they did pause the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we stopped the process nine months ago, we had a number,\u201d Schultz added. \u201cJust recently the Health Care Center Committee asked that we get an update to that number based on previous designs we had for the building.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update Schultz gave the full county board was $24.3 million for a 53-thousand square-foot facility, or $1.8 million more than estimates nine months ago. Schultz said major cost increases are now seen in several areas, like a 27 percent increase in electrical, a 19 percent jump for plumbing and 10 percent spikes for excavation\/earthwork and drywall. Other costs associated with planning for the project, furnishing the facility, professional fees and more bring the new estimated total to $27.2 million. That\u2019s a roughly 7.5 percent increase in the bottom line, according to Schultz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese are not today\u2019s dollars,\u201d said Nate Pearson of project management firm TEGRA. \u201cThey have a little inflationary factor on them for when we buy, with an anticipated buy schedule of next summer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those numbers are based on a 32-bed skilled nursing facility and eight-unit CBRF (community-based residential facility).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger concern is a structural deficit when it comes to actually operating the facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you move forward with the building and the operational deficit, you can see that if you maintain a consistent tax levy with where you are today, that the organization would run out of money,\u201d said Michael Peer from the project consultant firm of Clifton Larson Allen. \u201cThe operational needs, as well as the cost to build and repay the principal and interest on those bonds, would not cash flow based on the current operations and the current tax levy. In 2028 to 2029 would be essentially where the organization would run out of money,\u201d Peer added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supervisor Vinnie Miresse, also chairman of the Health Care Center Committee, advocated for the new facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe know that skilled nursing in our community is not a revenue-generating business,\u201d he said. \u201cOur staff is the best around. They are the shining beacon of the state right now, in terms of the services they provide. If we can find a way to make this project happen creatively we\u2019re going to see generational success, in terms of the care for our residents in Portage County,\u201d Miresse added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have initiated the process, and we\u2019ve worked with (Finance) Director (Jennifer) Jossie and with Maria (McDonald, Health Care Center Director) on getting dates and timelines,\u201d Miresse continued. \u201cOur next item here is to get the appropriate language for the referendum and the appropriate dollar amount together, so that we can submit that question to DOR (Department of Revenue) for their review. Once that review comes back, then we\u2019ll go to all the other committees for their blessing and then eventually to this body here,\u201d said Miresse. \u201cThat is a path. That is the referendum path. There are other ideas floating around right now. The voters have voted on this twice and supported it. I\u2019m getting a lot of emails saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re expecting Portage County to do this. Fund the building. Use the referendum for operational costs, which is completely within the parameters of that $4.5 million dollars.\u2019 It\u2019s just a matter now of making sure that this body has all of the data, all of the facts in front of them, so they can make an informed decision,\u201d said Miresse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been some rumblings about possibly selling the facility, but there was very little mention of that during the county board\u2019s discussion. Supervisor Jeanne Dodge did ask for information on that, if it is in fact being looked at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Health Care Committee had a speaker, a broker about selling the facility,\u201d said Dodge. \u201cQuite frankly, I think that we ought to have that information at hand as well. I know nothing about a willing buyer. It is an option that maybe the public would want to consider when they\u2019re voting on this referendum if it goes to referendum. So I think we need to be aware of all the options, which includes home health.

That\u2019s why Mrozek is working hard to build a \u201cPink Army\u201d in the community to bring awareness to the importance of a support system for those afflicted with the disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was diagnosed with a very aggressive breast cancer eight years ago,\u201d explained Mrozek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had taken care of my mom through her breast cancer medical journey. I stepped away from my career, moved her into my house, transported her for medical appointments, oversaw her medications, and made sure whatever she had a taste to eat I would do and bought her new clothing, whatever to keep her spirits up. But the one thing I would say is that women who go through a breast cancer diagnosis lose control mentally and physically. And they need to have unconditional support.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"490\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-1-221028.jpg\" alt=\"Pink Army Trish Mrozek\" class=\"wp-image-117685\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-1-221028.jpg 490w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-1-221028-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-1-221028-400x522.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-1-221028-459x600.jpg 459w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><figcaption>Trish Mrozek, at left, with her granddaughter, Abigail Bemowski, at SPASH&#8217;s &#8220;Diggin&#8217; the Cause&#8221; fundraiser held Oct. 13. <strong>Jessica Bemowski photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>\u201cLike I told her, don&#8217;t worry about your medical appointments. I will be there. So, you know, that&#8217;s the main thing with anyone who goes through a medical journey like that is you have to have somebody who just unconditionally steps forward on a daily basis; not just transporting one day a week to go for medical appointments, but somebody who&#8217;s actually going to be there to talk to the doctors. And then there&#8217;s a tremendous responsibility to do that medical research, because like in my mother&#8217;s case, she was just in shock when the diagnosis happened.\u201d<br><br>The Aspirus Foundation said that breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, accounting for one in three cancers diagnosed in women in this country. The lifetime risk of having breast cancer is 12.9 percent or one out of eight. The amount of invasive cases increase by eight times between those under 40 and those over 65.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSuddenly, it becomes like a whirlwind, even though I&#8217;m a very organized, positive person,\u201d Mrozek said.<br><br>\u201cThe movement of everything happening was unbelievable. I had the mammogram, the ultrasound on Friday. I was told to come back to the hospital on Monday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMonday when I had the MRI, it had grown an inch, so it was fast, it was aggressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat continued to happen \u2013 what I call shellshock whirlwind of events \u2013 is I got put into surgery to have a port put in that same day. It was like, what is happening?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That started five months of weekly chemotherapy and later a radical mastectomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFortunately, I had a strong network,\u201d Mrozek said, noting that her families and especially her significant other, Ken, were by her side to support her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe first time when the staff walks in with a shield over their face, headgear, protective garments, rubber gloves; it\u2019s a very scary feeling, because they are being protected but they are putting that into your system,\u201d Mrozek recalled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that mental affect on the patient is just as significant as the physical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe one thing that I&#8217;d like to say is patients really go through the journey physically, but as well as emotionally, and that goes along with their support persons as well. So having that positive support system for not only the patient, but for the family members as well is really important,\u201d said Amanda Boreen, Marshfield Clinic patient navigator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust being able to lend a listening ear or maybe suggest things that could be helpful such as, getting them the mail or cooking a meal or bringing over an activity, but just also that reminder that you are there for support. Sometimes the patient doesn&#8217;t want to inconvenience someone else by asking for help or as women were used to taking care of, maybe a majority of the household things\u2026So, if someone&#8217;s able to help out a little bit for them, it can really mean one less thing for them to do. They can feel good about that and rest and relax, and then the support person can feel good, that they&#8217;re able to help out as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust keeping things positive.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrozek added that life becomes different after a breast cancer diagnosis, so mentally you never look at things the same. While she is now in remission, she wants to go out and affect change and awareness, by enacting the community, or what Mrozek refers to as the \u201cPink Army.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI want to create an ongoing awareness in the community,\u201d Mrozek added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This includes supporting a program with the Stevens Point Police Department<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pink Badge Awareness Campaign<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNext year, their campaign of breast cancer pink badge awareness is going to be done in a very big way to where all the 46 police officers in the Stevens Point Police department are going to have the opportunity to wear the pink badges,\u201d Mrozek stated.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Pink Badge Awareness\" class=\"wp-image-117686\" width=\"497\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028-400x533.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028-450x600.jpg 450w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/FP-Pink-Army-2-221028.jpg 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" \/><figcaption>Tirsh Mrozek is assisting Police Chief Bob Kussow and the Stevens Point police department with the pink badge awareness campaign. <strong>Submitted photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Through her awareness campaign and philanthropy, Mrozek is assisting Police Chief Bob Kussow and the Stevens Point police department with the pink badge program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have an officer here whose wife is battling breast cancer. And we actually hand out ribbons to all of our officers for the month of October. And what I wanted to do as the chief was to show a little bit more support. So I approved pink badges,\u201d Chief Kussow explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe one thing though, is they&#8217;re very expensive, and the officers have to buy them themselves. And then, 10 percent of the proceeds go to breast cancer awareness and research. And so 10 of us purchased our own to represent the police department for breast cancer month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd when the news got out that we purchased 10 of them ourselves. We had Trish come forward who obviously is a survivor of breast cancer, and she actually wanted to donate money to purchase 36 more, so that every single officer next year can actually wear a pink badge to represent breast cancer month for October.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd what our plan is, the officers that purchased them can actually keep theirs and keep them for retirement for a shadowbox. And then, what we&#8217;ll do is every October the 36 people that didn&#8217;t purchase, we&#8217;re just going to have them sign them out for the month of October and then return them so we can keep track of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHopefully it will open up a dialogue where individuals will take a second and go in and get tested and try and get this thing caught early. It\u2019s already brought out people that are wondering about our pink badges, so it gives us an opportunity to just disclose to them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is just what Mrozek is working toward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe awareness needs to be there to remind all women to watch for symptoms signs but also family members, whether it&#8217;s a husband, significant other, daughter, son, to remind the women in their life to get breast cancer exams and also if they see a change in the women in their life, health-wise, to tell them to go in for a checkup,\u201d Mrozek said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Kris Leonhardt STEVENS POINT \u2013 Trish Mrozek is no stranger to breast cancer or the positive effects of a strong network for those diagnosed.

The project will improve accessibility and connect neighborhoods, offering east side residents north of Highway 10 the first and only safe and convenient connection to the award-winning Green Circle Trail. In addition, the trail will offer west side residents a safe pedestrian\/bike route to two major youth recreational soccer and hockey complexes, shopping, restaurants and the Holiday Inn Convention Center,\u201d a city release stated.<br>\u201cThe TAP grant award requires a 20 percent local match and a fund has been established in the Community Foundation of Central Wisconsin to accept gifts to this cause.

The nurses told us how reading to babies also helped stimulate their brain development, a crucial thing for a baby as early as he was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cToday, Elliot is a healthy five-year-old (almost six) and we want to give hope to other families and share our story.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing a local need and a way to assist other families, Ryan and his wife, Katie, created \u201cElliot\u2019s Little Library.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNICU families have quite the challenge, normally parents bond with their baby through holding them, feeding them, rocking them, etc. In the NICU, that is often not a possibility. We definitely feel that books changed our lives during that time and want to ensure that other families have this opportunity,\u201d Ryan explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy wife Katie and I started Elliot\u2019s Little Library back in 2017, but back then it was simply a set of 24 books that we donated to the Marshfield Children\u2019s Hospital NICU ourselves. Those books included a bookmark with our story and we designated them to go to families that would likely have a NICU stay similar to ours (our son was in the NICU for 96 days). We did this again in 2018, but started talking about trying to \u2018go bigger.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot Victory\" class=\"wp-image-117452\" width=\"503\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/stevenspoint.news\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/FP-Elliot-Library-2-220824.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" \/><figcaption>A grown up Elliiot assists with delivering books. <strong>Submitted photo<\/strong><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cIn 2019, we asked friends and family for help donating books. Our goal was to have enough books to donate to Marshfield so that every baby with a stay longer than one week would get a book. We were successful and donated 225 books to the hospital. In 2020, we had even more success; we received so many books that we expanded to the Stevens Point NICU (at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital) and the Aspirus Wausau Hospital NICU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn 2021, we received enough books to start talking to our fourth NICU location.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan said that they will soon be expanding and that their next location will be in the Appleton area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They recently kicked off their 2022 Book Drive.

However, it has evolved since then. Last year, event goers could choose between a virtual biking challenge, an in-person ride, or both.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s Pedal Point Rally will now also feature an ice cream ride and rally dinner on July 15. Riders will meet at the Hostel Shoppe to bike approximately 10 miles to local ice cream shops to devour an ice cream cone, then ride back to the Hostel Shoppe to enjoy a delicious dinner provided by KitchensBrew to kick off the event weekend. To participate in the ice cream ride and rally, you must pay a $50 registration fee; this fee will cover both Friday and Saturday events.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The in-person main event will meet on July 16, at the Hostel Shoppe, where riders can choose between five different ride lengths: a 60-mile ride, 40-mile ride, 20-mile ride, 13-mile ride, or 4-mile Rich Johnson Family ride. Participants can choose to be a part of a team or ride individually but there is a $25 registration fee for adults and a $10 registration fee for children to participate in just Saturday\u2019s event. Prices for registration will go up on July 1st. Boys &amp; Girls Club members ride free thanks to Mark Toyota of Plover. To register, visit www.bgclubpc.org\/pedalpointrally.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday\u2019s event will feature an award ceremony, food trucks, a bounce house, and games for participants to enjoy. Awards will be given to the participant who bikes the most miles and the participant who raises the most in pledges or donations. Portesi Italian Foods will be providing cheese fries and pizza for children to eat free.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pedal Point Rally raises funds for Boys &amp; Girls Club programming. This year marks the 20th Anniversary of the Club, which currently serves 2,000 youth.

Szynskie, director of Community Partners of Portage County and a member of the Coalition.<\/p>\n<p>Because more people are staying indoors again this year because of the pandemic, Szynskie said members of the Coalition are compiling an informative packet to distribute to businesses in the area, including the downtown, Crossroads Commons and bus stop locations so everyone can experience improved access during the winter season.<\/p>\n<p>Pedestrian travel can be especially difficult, a situation exacerbated by the almost daily light snowfall this area has received in recent weeks. When it snows, she said, people with limited mobility encounter issues with getting around. An accessible route should be a minimum of 36 inches wide, not just a path the width of a shovel.<\/p>\n<p>Handicapped parking spaces are sometimes used for snow storage, and snowbanks and icy walkways create barriers to access services and local businesses. Individuals who use a van with a life need to be able to extend that lift into the access aisle adjacent to a handicapped parking space.<\/p>\n<p>A ramp to a building should also be shoveled first to clear the snow and ice before the steps. The ramp can be used by all people, but the steps cannot.<br \/>\nThis year, the Coalition has created some helpful best practices guides for \u201cAccessibility for all Seasons,\u201d along with an awareness campaign to help improve conditions on sidewalks, at bus stops and in parking lots, Szynskie said.<\/p>\n<p>The Coalition is asking residents to \u201cAdopt a Curb Cut,\u201d the wheelchair ramps at intersections that seem to collect all the snow from the street as snow plows go around a corner to clear the roads of snow. People in wheelchairs are unable to use an unshoveled ramp and have to travel in the road, creating a dangerous situation.<\/p>\n<p>Szynskie said the Coalition plans to push the campaign this year and then grow it next year in its second year. \u201cWe\u2019ll approach local businesses this year and then work more on information to citizens next year,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started small, but every year we want to bring awareness to the program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to make everyone aware of the situation with disabilities,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause almost everyone is going to experience some form of physical disability in life as they age.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The curb cuts are often ignored because the first duty of snowplows is to clear the roads of snow, and it takes quite some time to clear every street in the city. Trying to clear each ramp would take plows too much time, leaving roads unplowed. So that duty falls to residents.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals with visual impairments especially need walkways free of ice and snow. Clear sidewalks are also appreciated by mail carriers, delivery drivers and emergency personnel.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe city will support it wholeheartedly,\u201d Stevens Point Mayor Mike Wiza said about the Coalition\u2019s efforts, which he has been promoting since learning about them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need citizens with good hearts to put the effort into action,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens need to clear fire hydrants and curb cuts. Such actions are necessary to be part of a thriving community.\u201d<br \/>\nHe pointed out the city has an ordinance that homeowners and building occupants are responsible for removing snow and ice from the sidewalk in front of their house or building within 24 hours of the end of any snowfall.<\/p>\n<p>If the snow is not removed by homeowners or occupants, the city may have it removed by a contractor, and the city will add the bill to property taxes for the property owner. Having to pay those bills is a major complaint among people who don\u2019t clear their sidewalks.<\/p>\n<p>The Police and Street Departments both ask that all residents help keep their neighborhoods safe by shoveling the wheelchair curb cuts at intersections, and pay particular attention to sidewalks and crosswalks in school zones.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire Department appreciates residents\u2019 help in keeping fire hydrants clear of snow and ice. Firefighters need to access fire hydrants in case of a fire, and keeping the fire hydrants clear of snow and ice does save people\u2019s homes.<\/p>\n<p>Together, the people of Portage County can provide safe access to everyone in the community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Gene Kemmeter The Portage County Disability Coalition is encouraging area businesses and residents to keep their sidewalks and wheelchair curb cuts at intersections clear of snow and ice so people, especially those with disabilities, can get through.

To improve the chances of survival for lung cancer patients, Aspirus Health has developed a lung nodule clinic that will combine early screening for at-risk patients with minimally invasive, robotic-assisted lung biopsies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is important to diagnose whether lung nodules are cancerous as early as possible because it makes a significant difference in quality of life and survival rates of our patients,\u201d said Dr. Bret Stysly, critical care and pulmonary medicine physician. \u201cLung nodules do not typically cause any symptoms and may go undetected, so it is important to have a screening process for at-risk patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Aspirus Health\u2019s new lung nodule clinic is located at Aspirus Wausau Hospital and brings together the knowledge and skill of a multidisciplinary team of thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiologists, radiation and medical oncologists, and pathologists who collaborate to evaluate and treat all patients. The goal is to screen all patients who have a risk of developing lung cancer. If the lung screening indicates the presence of lung nodules, a personalized follow-up care plan is developed.<\/p>\n<p>In October, Aspirus Health became just the second healthcare system in Wisconsin to perform robotic lung biopsies. Aspirus surgeons began using a platform called the Intuitive Ion to perform robotic-assisted bronchoscopy. The ultra-thin, flexible catheter in the Ion can be moved 180 degrees in all directions. It allows surgeons to navigate through very tight spots inside the lungs to collect nodule tissues that previously could not be reached.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEarly stages of lung cancer can be challenging to diagnose since tissue samples can be deep within the lungs and difficult to reach,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Eilers, cardiothoracic surgeon. \u201cThe Ion robot has changed the game on our ability to reach these tissues for an early diagnosis. This is another example of the steps we take to make early diagnoses and provide better outcomes for our patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Aspirus Wausau Hospital is the first hospital in central Wisconsin to offer a lung nodule clinic and adopt this new minimally invasive state-of-the-art technology.
